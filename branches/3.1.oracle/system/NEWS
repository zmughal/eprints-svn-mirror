This file describes the major changes between versions. In addition you
can assume every new version fixes minor bugs and typos. If you want to
see the blow by blow account of every single change see the file called
CHANGELOG.
======================================================================

=========================================================================
EPRINTS 3.1.3
=========================================================================

In brief:
 * You will need to upgrade the database structure using epadmin upgrade,
    see below for more details.
 * The new JSON export plugin exposes all the metadata from on EPrint, if
    you disabled the XML export you may wish to disable this too.

Views
 * New config. style for views (old style still works too)
 * Views "menu" pages can now be split up, eg. A-C, D-F, G-I etc. (new 
    default Author view uses this option)
 * Fixed a bug where bad view URLs created huge pages and ate memory.
 * Removed bogus xmlns attributes.

JSON
 * Added both an export plugin, plus a CGI script to allow javascript 
    callbacks (which allows mashups to work on your data).
 * To turn on the callback script to allow mashups etc. set 
    $c->{json}->{enable} = 1; 
    in the config. This is set by default on new repositories.
 * The syntax of the callback script is 
    /cgi/json?callback=my_function&eprintid=23
 * The data exposed by the JSON export plugin is the same as for EP3XML
    so if you have sensitive data in your records, you may wish to 
    disable it, and not enable the callback script.

Unicode
 * Several fixes to issues with encoding.

OAI
 * Added support for custom OAI sets, which helps us meet the DRIVER spec.
 * Fixed a bug where GetRecord returned records it shouldn't.

FTP
 * This is an experiemental tool. It is not recommended you run this on a 
    production server without chatting with us first. However it is pretty 
    cool.

Toolbox
 * addDocument now returns the numerical ID of the document rather than "OK".

Input Workflow
 * Multiple fields can now contain <help> and <name> in their sub fields.
 * Can now use Subject input component with other fields in a workflow

Database
 * The schema ID has been increased as we have standardised that all parts
    of a name field will be NULL or set, not a mixture. Upgrading the DB
    using epadmin will fix this scruffy data, but the resulting database 
    structure will be still compatible with earlier 3.1.* releases, but if
    you downgrade you'll need to modify the "version" table back to 3.1.1

Other
 * Whitespace now auto-stripped from DOIs & Pubmed IDs.
 * Fixed issue in encoding paths for documents with subdirectories.
 * Fixed autocomplete javascript under HTTPS.

=========================================================================
EPRINTS 3.1.2
=========================================================================

Admin Tools
 * "Edit phrases" tool appears in toolbar for admins, on pages that are
    generated "on the fly". It allows web-based editing of the phrases
    used to generate the page, including missing phrases.
 * Improvements to web based phrase editor.
 * "Edit page" option now appears if a static page is viewed by an
    admin, making it easy to get to the right edit screen.

Views
 * In views, links to empty pages are now rendered as text, not links.
 * /view/ pages may now be exported in the same way as searches.

Search
 * search.pl is now split into one file per search.
 * Search forms now have a show_help option to allow the help to be
    always hidden or always shown. The default is the toggle button.

Submission
 * Can now use <upload-methods> option in upload component 
    configuration, in a workflow, to set which methods are available 
    to upload files (or set to an empty list to stop new documents being 
    created). Zip, from url etc.
 * Document fields can now be marked as required, and will have the star
    appear and report problems if not set. 
 * Now when you add a document or modify one, it's always unrolled when 
    the page upload form is rendered.

Import & Export
 * RSS2 now has thumbnail and media data, this allows some new fun 
    mash-up.
 * New Excel and CSV import and export plugins.

Saved Search and Review emails
 * Improved style of HTML format emails.
 * Fixed broken links in emails.

Other
 * .xpage files can now have a <template> to override the use of the 
    default template.
 * Many bugfixes. Notably in emails, views and unicode handling. See 
    CHANGELOG for details.

=========================================================================
EPRINTS 3.1.1
=========================================================================

 * Added "up" link in views to go one level up.
 * Many bugfixes. See CHANGELOG for full details.

=========================================================================
EPRINTS 3.0-RC-1                                               2006-12-18
=========================================================================

 * More basic types of eprint:
    Artefact, Exhibition, Composition, Performance, Image, Video,
    Audio, Dataset, Experiment, Teaching Resource.
 * Import via PubMed ID.
 * Import via DOI.

    you type and lists them as a warning.
 * New autocomplete scripts which can use a file or a database table for
    the lookup.
 * Added a multilingual field type for multilingual titles, abstracts 
    etc.
 * Import and Export via XML of multilingual and compound fields now 
    treats compound fields as one field.

     make setup even easier.
 * Fixed bug which left many cache tables lying around.
 * Tool to edit the subject tree
 * Non-required boolean fields now show a third option to allow them to
    be set to unspecified.
 * Plugins may now have an "advertise" flag. If this is false then the
    plugin is not advertised in the user interface but is still 
    available.
 * Plugins may now be disabled by default. This is used if you have 
    several repositories and only want to enable the plugin on one.
 * XML Export now makes the XML nicely indented.
 * The workflow may now conditionally limit the options available for a 
    set. This allows, for example, to make certain options only available
    on some types of EPrint or only to certain users.
 * The workflow may modify the top subject node so that different parts
    of the subject tree are available for different eprints or users.
 * New default fields for projects and funders and organisational 
    divisions.
 * Added more metadata to the <head> of the summary pages, for the 
    benefit of search engines.
