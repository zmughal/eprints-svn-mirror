workflow options: default surround.

component options:
attr: component type - REQUIRED
XML config
attr: collapsed 
attr: surround to use (get from workflow)


attr of <wf:field>
required="yes"
required="no" (default)
required="for_archive" (should show required icon to staff)
collapsed="yes" (ignored if field is required, is for_archive and in staff mode, has data set)
collapsed="no"

Library function which parses

<field required="foo" name="bar" />

that field in same namespace as workflow.

surround has a method which returns XHTML for a required icon.

any render method of components get passed a pointer to the surround.


surround->render_required
component->is_collapsed (base level has utiltity method which takes X field structures and a dataobj)
component->are_these_all_collapsed( list-of-field-objects {required, name, collapsed} )

Component field object (maybe not in plugins) which takes XML of <field> and returns object with field id, field handle, required, collapsed etc. EPrints::InputField?
