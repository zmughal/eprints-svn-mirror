 * deprecated input_style=textarea

 * Make a permission for users to be able to edit their OWN records.
 * News Items
 - Alternate config files for simple english only archives.

 - Peer Review
 - Mirroring
 - Citation Scanning
 - "People who read this eprint also read..."
 - OpenURL support (?)

 - Templates
 - CD-ROM publisher - create ISO of an archive.

Metadata Fields
 ? New field type "time" for datetime SQL fields.
 * Add XHTML field renderer with list of legal tags.

Bulk Import / Export
 * abstract mapping functions.
    - RIS
    - bibtex
    - XML
    - other...
 * Generic bulk import system

    - with a script
 * Generic bulk export system
    - linked to search results
    - with a script

OAI

 * Extra sets in OAI: By ID field, or by configurable serialised search. 
    Even "subject" should be configured. so "subject:blgy:biophys" 
    or "username_id:cjg" or "stuffjackwants" which is a search of 
    it's own. Searches can of course be modified with from and to 
    dates from OAI.


Database

 * Turn docid into an int (no minor feat) [longterm]
 * check Database.pm for any sql without escaping. and 
    SearchExpression.pm and SearchField.pm 


Search

 * Make nice ordering for titles so "the" does not affect order
      + similar in other fields? names?
 * Add congiguration via cookie for n results, citation style &
    default search.
 - Don't index words in inbox/buffer? [maybe/maybe not]
 * Add search-by-id
 * Fix email searches
 - reconsider max time for caches eg. 30 for latest?
 - Phrase searching
 - Improved steming.
 - Add a get_problems method to searchexp which returns a list
    of problems. This should run by default when verifying "search"
    type fields?
 - Create buffer uses VARCHAR for a key, not.. er... INT where possible.
   eg. for subject and document


Command Line Tools
 
 * generate_views needs to say what order stuff is in. [kinda hard, it
     uses a custom order]
 * Clean up export XML command. [XML headers etc.]
 * For generate_views, subscriptions, abstracts etc. Maybe have an
          archiveid of ALL which runs the script once for each archive?
      + or allow more than one.
 . Make tools run as "eprints" if they are running as "root". 
    -Forces "Taint" checking which certain eprints bits just can't darn
       handle.

 
Submission Page

 - Extra pages which are user defined.
 - Make a simple version of file upload for archives which only want one
          (PDF) document with no security etc.

Clean up
 - remove die statements
 - paint 4th bridge: remove all cjg statements

CGI Tools
 - List of admin/editors

0------------------------------------------------0
 
 
 
 


 Other Stuff
 
 
 +       Make a way of .css working in both https and http - possibly
         a new entity which does something different on the https server.
 
 - CSS searchfield input.
 
 + Option for "subjects" to not appear with heirarchy when presented
  in input forms.
 
 . Commentary summary page (Psycoloquy style)
 
 + Rename "create_foo" on DataObjs onto just "create".
 
 + Stop refering directly to System::Settings - allow archive specific
  tweaks.
 
 + cmp methods : is they still needed?
 
 +  List of editors?
 
 - langid's -> validate they is correct (in multilang)
 
 + No new eprints when disk fullish
 
 + Bad Things(tm) will happen if a session has a langid which is not a 
  supported langid - can this happen?
 
 +  robots.txt file
 
 +  Check Referer on LatexCache.?
 
 -  Debugging helpers - make session and searchexp notice if they are 
  DESTROY'd without being terminate/disposed.
 
 - PDF Mollycoddler ( Serve PDF in a special way which avoids certain 
  bugs in the plugin )
 
 - CSS Mollycoddler ( Serve an empty CSS if a 404 is encountered when
  looking for a .css file - to help out NS4.)
 
 - Make some eprint types require different/no document types, eg. 
  books.
