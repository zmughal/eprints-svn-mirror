<h1>Mailing Lists</h1>

<P>We currently have two mailing lists, described below. In addition you may be interested
in the OAI mailing lists - see the <A href="http://www.openarchives.org">Open Archives Initiative</A> pages.</P>

<H3>eprints-announce</H3>

<p>If you want to be informed when new versions of the <a href="software.html">eprints software</a> become available, then you can join the <strong>eprints.org</strong> announcement mailing list.</p>

<p>The mailing list will be a very low-volume list and will be used for no other purpose than to inform recipients of the availability of the further revisions of the <a href="software.html">eprints.org software</a>, and any major revisions of the <strong>eprints.org</strong> website. Only authorised users can mail to the list; it cannot be used as a discussion list.</p>

<H3>eprints-tech</H3>

<P>This is the technical discussion list for people who are using eprints and/or are interested in the technical side of eprints.org - getting it working, customising it and new directions for the next version. </P>

<P>The technical discussion list is <A href="http://threader.ecs.soton.ac.uk/lists/eprints-tech/">archived online</A>.</P>
