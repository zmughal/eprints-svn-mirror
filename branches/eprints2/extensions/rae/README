eprints-rae: facilitates the RAE process via an EPrints archive.

FILES

raedata

	based on the rae/rae_fields config, renders an input form for
users to enter their measures of esteem. Values are stored in a
rae_data table for the archive.

raeselect

	based on the rae/search_id config, renders an interface for
users to search for and select RAE items. Selected items are recorded in
a rae_selected table for the archive.

	the rae/init config allows the search form to be initialised for 
the given user.

raereport

	based on the rae/group_by config, renders a reporting interface for 
RAE returns. The rae/exclude_group and rae/show_all configs can be used
to hide certain groups and provide an 'all staff' group respectively. The 
rae/check_item config is called for each item in in order to report problems
(for example, an item is selected by more than one user, an item has no
documents attached). 

	the rae/csv-[header|row|footer] configs generate CSV
output specific to the requirements of an institution.

RAELoader.pm	

	loads archives/[archiveid]/cfg/rae-phrases-en.xml and 
archives/[archiveid]/cfg/ArchiveRAEConfig.pm and 'injects' RAE-specific 
phrases/config into the current Archive object.

	only reloaded thereafter if phrases or config files change.

ArchiveRAEConfig.pm

	defines an archive-specific RAE configuration.

	needs to be placed under archives/[archiveid]/cfg/.

rae-phrases-en.xml

	defines language- and archive-specific RAE phrases.

	needs to be placed under archives/[archiveid]/cfg/.
