This file describes the major changes between versions. In addition you
can assume every new version fixes minor bugs and typos. If you want to
see the blow by blow account of every single change see the file called
CHANGELOG.
======================================================================

EPRINTS 2.3.7                                                  2004-11-25
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - No longer depends on libapreq
 - Required formats may now be varied depending on eprint. For example
    an eprint of type "book" may not require any formats, whereas a 
    "article" may require PDF or HTML. 
 - Added search support for special case where a search is being done
    over names and text fields and a two letter surname is searched for.
 - Three new config options for fields: input_assist, input_advice_right
    and input_advice_below.
 - General revamp of default style, added print style sheet, an XSLT 
    file for OAI responses, nicer use of CSS, file sizes in metadata
    page.
 - Made RSS output standards compliant.
 - Added an RSS output mode compatible with buggy postnuke RSS handler.
 - Added warnings over unrecognised config options, rather than silent
    ignore. This should help catch typos.
 - Submission buffer now sorted by submission date.
 - Added option to allow buttons to appear at top of search pages.
 - Reduced startup message to a single line.
 - New script; erase_fulltext_cache to force re-indexing of fulltext.

EPRINTS 2.3.6                                                  2004-08-09
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Fix of bug introduced in 2.3.5

EPRINTS 2.3.5                                                  2004-08-06
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - New options and logging for indexer.
 - XHTML produced by EPrints no longer contains xmlns attributes, this
    should make it possible to properly validate the XHTML.
 - Short URL's: The the URL of an eprint is now /123/ instead of
    /archive/00000123/. This must be enabled in existing archives. Old
    URL's will continue to work.
 - Caching function for full text to reduce CPU load of indexer.
 - Support for hungarian characters in indexer.
 - Bugfixes.

EPRINTS 2.3.4                                                  2004-07-06
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Bugfixes.

EPRINTS 2.3.3                                                  2004-03-04
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Added explain_sql_tables script which explains what all 
    the SQL tables are used for. Handy for hacking and debugging.
 - Fixes to generate_views handling of subjects fields.
 - Fixes for Apache 2 compatibility
 - The name of a language can now be specified in an language specific 
    phrase file. Added a new method to session: render_language_name
    which renders the given name in the right language. 
 - The string used to join names (and other field types) can now be
    varied for the first or last item. So you can join names with ", "
    but for the last pair use " and ".

EPRINTS 2.3.2                                                  2004-02-25
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Fixes for MySQL 4 compatibility.
  - Fixes some problems with generate_views handling of subjects.
  - Fixes for Apache 2 compatibility.

EPRINTS 2.3.1                                                  2004-02-05
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - "last indexed" information to search results page so that users won't
    be (as) confused if a search does not contain an item they just 
    added.
 - Browse by 'name' fields now works. So you can have a static "browse"
    page for each unique author name eg. Fenderson,_Marvin.html - this
    is not perfect as he may also by Fenderson,_M.html etc. Or you 
    might have to Marvin Fendersons. Browse by author ID is still a
    safer bet in the long term.
 - Hooks so thta input fields can vary based on other factors. This 
    should allow input fields which can (for example) limit the options
    in one field based on values in another.
 - Fixes for Perl 5.8 compatibility.

EPRINTS 2.3.0                                                  2004-01-12
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Date fields may now be configured so that only the year part is
    required, with month and day optional. They may be treated as
    if they were "year" fields for browsing and rendering citations.
 - Completely new default fields, help and citations. Based on the
    work of the TARDIS project.
 - The registration process has been cleaned up a bit. Now change
    password and register for new account are two seperate forms.
    Also, fields from the user dataset can be added to the register
    page (eg. Name), to save doing it later.
 - If a user record is not valid the users home page now automatically
    redirects to the edit my details page.
 - Changed layout of the users home page. Cleaner layout.
 - Metadata "types" code completely rewritten so as to be object-
    oriented. Eg. Url extends Text. This should allow sites to add
    their own custom types with unique rendering, input, storage
    and search properties.
 - Filters. As described for searches filters allow you to limit
    the results of searches to only those matching a hard-wired 
    setting. Filters can also be applied to the OAI interface and
    latest_tool and will be applicable to views in a subsequent 
    version.
 - Citations are now full of <span> tags indicating fields and
    also peoples names. Handy for style-sheeting.
 - Apache 2 support.
 - OAI Config now roughly follows Andy Powell's recomendations. nb.
    This only affects new archives.
 - Multilang archives can now understand the browsers language 
    preference.
 - Views may now have sub-pages eg. /year/2000/article.html 
    (browse by year then type). 
 - Views may now have sub-headings. eg. Browse by year, but results
    page is divided into <h3>Article</h3>.....<h3>Book</h3>...etc.
 - New CGI Tool: latest_tool. This lists the last "n" additions to
    the archive. It can also have more than one "mode". Eg. Another
    mode might be to output the last "n" items which had full
    texts attached. It can also be made to output results in
    RSS format.
 - New CGI Tool: counter. This just lists the size of each dataset
    in a simple, machine-readable way. This is to allow eprints.org
    to monitor growth of archives in a low-impact way.
 - Option to work with Apache 2. Apache 2.0 support relies on
    3rd party libraries which are in active development. 
 - Tested with perl 5.8 on Redhat 9.0. Some bugs fixed with unicode
    support problems.
 - MimeTex support.

Submission & Data Input 
 - Option to make the eprint type selection a list with radio buttons
    and long descriptions, rather than just an HTML option element.
    (submission_long_types). This is the default for new archives.
 - Paged metadata input. Rather than overwhelm the user with a huge
    form, the eprint metadata input may now be split into several
    small stages.
 - New input_style for "set" and "datatype" fields: "long". This
    renders them as a deliniated list with radio buttons and long
    descriptions taken from the phrase file. (This is the option 
    which "submission_long_types" turns on for the system field
    "type".
 - The input method for fields can now be completely replaced with
    alternate code. A much nicer input method for "subjects" is 
    supplied.
 - Changed the layout of the submission form. Now has control buttons
    at the top and bottom with one being "save for later" (rather 
    than the confusing "cancel"). The file upload section is now 
    much quicker and cleaner. It does not even ask what the
    "primary file" is unless there are two or more files in the 
    document.
 - "Help" for metadata input fields can now have HTML elements in
     including links or javascript pop-ups. Different help may be
     supplied for different types, eg. The help for title-of-article
     can be different from title-of-book.
 - Improvement to input-form-render for metafields. The layout is
    now much more compact. Multiple fields now have arrow buttons
    to allow them to be easily re-ordered.
 - Improvements to the VLit transcluding interface.

Searching & Indexing
 - Search Field help may now contain HTML.
 - Indexing and search code rewritten. Now indexing is done by
    a daemon which runs in the background. This means that you don't
    have to wait for the indexes to keep updating while editing a 
    live record.
 - Web-interface searches redesigned. No longer "simple" and 
    "advanced", but as many different search configurations as you 
    need. Searches can have custom citation style, items-per-page,
    title, help and can even have "filters". Filters allow you to,
    for example, limit a search to papers where status="published"
    without that being an option in the form.
 - Full text search tool. This uses the bundled Convert::PlainText
    module. That just provides a wrapper to various UNIX tools which
    extract the words.
 - New name search syntax. "Smith, R" will match "Smith, Robert" 
    and a search for "Smith, Robert" will match "Smith, R".
 - Searching fields of type "date" now possible. Allows searching
    of just years or exact dates.
 - Staff searches are now just like the new user searches. By default
    there are searches to search the user, buffer, inbox, archive
    and deletion datasets, but more can be added.


EPRINTS 2.2.0                                                  2002-10-31
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*       Fixed several minor issues in OAI2 support.

*       Several changes to defaul configuration (eg. default results
        page number of records now 100, not 10).

*       New field for subscriptions: mailempty? which makes mailing
        empty subscriptions optional.

*       Added option to have "subject editors" who may only edit certain
        eprints, ie. all in one subject, or only books & posters.

*       Added editor alerts to mail editors, similar to subscriptions.
 
*       Added a hook for doing something "clever" with certain 404's. This
        is useful if you are migrating from a different system, eg. eprints 
        v1 and want the old links to be forwarded to relevant new locations.

*       New metadata parameters
             - can_clone
             - sql_index
             - id_editors_only 
             - allow_set_order 
        See the relevant documentation for more information.

*       Added support for XML::GDOME which is a faster XML module, but does
        require some more software. This is strongly recommended for non-demo
        systems as it's faster and uses less memory.

*       Improvemnts to generate_views including
              - optional timestamps (when they were generated)
              - option to hide subjects with no eprints in yet

*       Automatic hash checksum logging. Every time a document file is 
        changed, a MD5 hash value is stored. See the documentation for why
        this is useful. A command "rehash" will generate and log hashes for
        all documents (handy to do initially). The command line tool 
        export_hashes will create a hash of each hash file for logging away
        safely.

*       Searches may now have default values.

*       Improved layout and information of "status" page. Now mentions last
        time subscriptions were mailed.

*       New command line tool which causes archives to reload their 
        configuration without restarting apache. This is NOT very efficient 
        and will waste memory, but is handy for development.

*       Citations now use @year@ instead of &year; to make XML parsing easier. 
        Also there is a new feature <ep:ifmatch> which gives access to the 
        eprints search syntax to make citation elements conditional. Also 
        improvements have been made to the citation rendering code so that 
        elements may now be safely nested.  (eg. <ep:isset>.

*       No GIFs (Due to patent issues, and EPrints being part of GNU),
        PNGs used instead.

*       Improved configurability of subscription mails layout.

*       Improved configurability of search result pages layout.
 
*       There is now a "Submit Later" button on the deposit page.

*       Added experimental support for the secure part of the site to
        be served via https.

*       Experimental paracite support. This will link a list of references 
        (in the metadata) to the paracite.eprints.org service.


EPRINTS 2.1.1                                                  2002-07-04
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug in the OAI 2.0 support. Otherwise identical to EPrints 2.1.


EPRINTS 2.1                                                    2002-07-04
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release contains a major new feature - subscriptions. It also has
OAI-PMH v2.0 support and a few new configuration options.

*       Various bug-fixes, typo-fixes and clarification of text.

*       Added subscriptions - which allows a user to configure searches to
        be run periodically and any new results mailed to them.

*       Now OAI 2 compliant. Note OAI-PMH v2 base URL is different to OAI
        v1 URL - /perl/oai2 - /perl/oai will continue to work.

*       New options in SystemSettings.pm 

        - disable_df which is set disables all the places eprints uses "df". 
          (It is buggy on some platforms).

        - virtualhost which is the value to use in the apache config files
          in VirtualHost entries. By default "*" is used, but some people need
          to change it.

*       Added "POD" documentation to about half of the main perl modules. The
        other modules have stubs describing the methods, but no actual 
        documentation. Use "perldoc Foo.pm" to view docs of a file.

*       Added a new type of metafield - "search". Which is a serialised 
        search expression. Not very useful for normal metadata - the primary
        use is for subscriptions.

*       You can now use XHTML entities in the phrase files, static pages
        and the page template eg. &nbsp; &pound; &eacute; etc. These are
        not available in the citations config file.

*       New built-in "custom" field render method: 
        EPrints::Utils::render_xhtml_field which can be set as a 
        render_single_value option in a metafield, it will pass through
        all XHTML elements rather than &lt;foo&gt; escaping them which the
        normal renderer does.

*       New optional configuration options:

        - "pagehooks" to allow extra "stuff" to be added in the <body> and 
          <head> parts and attributes to the <body> tag. This allows people 
          to do clever stuff, like add javascript to some pages.

        - "submission_stages" which allows the admin to change the order
          of the submission form.

        - "submission_hide_howmanyfiles"
          "submission_hide_upload_archive"
          "submission_hide_upload_graburl"
          "submission_hide_upload_plain" - these allow an admin to supress
          parts of the eprints file upload page.

*       New metafield attributes: 

        - export_as_xml: This defaults to 1 but if explicitly set to zero it 
          will supress this field in output from export_xml.

        - make_value_orderkey: this is a reference to a function which will
          generate a value to compare alphabetically to order this field.

        - make_single_value_orderkey: as above but only gets passed individual
          values even if the field is multiple.
        
        - fieldnames: used by search fields to configure which fields can be
          searched.  

*       New script - upgrade. This updates the SQL database of an archive to
        work with the latest version of eprints.

*       generate_views should now correctly sort values in the index paeg.

*       Order by subjects, sets or datatypes should now be alphabetical.
       



eprints-2.0.1                                                  2002-04-16
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mostly a bugfix release. Does not change any functionality. (except the 
staff EPrint search)

*       Fixed lots of typos and minor bugs.

*       Changed the default subjects config file to Library of Congress

*       Staff EPrint search can now search all buffers: archive, inbox, 
        buffer and deletion.

*       edit_eprint can now edit eprints in any buffer, and move eprints 
        between buffer, and clone any eprint into the submission buffer.

*       view_submission & edit_submission are now deprecated. All their 
        functions have been taken over by edit_eprint.

*       Added a oai2 script which is experimental and more-or-less speaks
        OAI-PMH v2.0a3


eprints-2.0                                                    2002-02-14
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

First official release.

*        Too many changes to mention.


eprints-2-alpha-2                                              2002-01-09
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the origional release of eprints 2. It did not actually do 
anything very useful, it just let people see how the project was
progressing.
