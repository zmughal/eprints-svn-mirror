eprints (3.2.0-beta-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [Christopher Gutteridge <cjg@ecs.soton.ac.uk>]
  * beta-1
  * Added EPrints::Page for API handling of web pages. Mostly resolving #3579.

  * The RDF config now uses triggers
  * Fixed some unicode issues in the rdf .pl files.

  * Fixed bug that reported on messages when illegal /view/ urls were requested. Closes #3614
  * Catch and ignore Apache IO complaint when a web client disconnects before we were done. Closes #3604
  * Fixed bug which meant /view/foo did not redirect to /view/foo/ (closes #3611)
  * Added a detailed level 5 log level to indexer to show details of every single task. Closes #3605.
  * Force binmode of outgoing filehandle of a list-export to be utf-8. Gets rid of a bunch of wide-character warnings.
  * Rename text in status page to reflect the fact that the queue is now more than indexing fields.
  * If there's no main file set, but only one file, return that as the main file.
  * Removed DC triples, closing #3606
  * Fixed typo in sameas, now it should spot text/n3 too
  * Added example code to uri_person to show how to prevent extrapolation of email (or ID) from the URI.

  * Fixed potential race condition due to not explicitly checking status is still "waiting" when doing the dequeue update
  * Dequeue upto 10 items at a time (more efficient)
  * MetaField::Search now has two properties:
  * "namedfields" which is an array ref of field names to search OR
  * "namedfields_config" which is the name of a config variable
  * MetaField::Search can now be used in any workflow (not hard-coded to editpermfields)

  * AND must subquery ORs
  * Fixed bug in dataset joins not using left-side key (e.g. eprint by-username lookup)
  * ANDs now use sub-queries when applying multiple conditions to the same non-main table - i=x AND i=y is always false on the main table
  * Split SubQuery into OR- and AND- based subqueries

  * Fixed strict refs breaking calls to upgrade methods
  * Oops, s/self/new_eprint/
  * Subobjects are now created in DataObj::create_from_data
  * In queue_all don't bother with create_unique as it's unlikely to ever create a queue_all twice for a new object

  * Fixed an HTML insertion bug in the <title> element [Brian D. Gregg]
  * By passing HTML fragments to anything that is echoed in the title (e.g. search parameters) arbitrary HTML/javascript can be injected into the page
  * To exploit this someone would need to follow a poisoned link
  * To supply file data to a File object use "_content", which can take a sub, file handle or scalar reference.
  * Storage controller will now write content to all configured plugins
  * Small efficiency tweak for History - don't bother writing a temp file
  * Fixed spurious history objects being created on document upload
  * Modified DataObj to clear changed fields after commit
  * Only commit in files_modified if files were actually modified
  * Some background: When a document was being uploaded two instances of the eprint object were being created - one in the form update and another as an on-demand parent of the new document. Both of these objects were then being committed, resulting in two history objects for the same revision. This may not have been an issue before because eprint objects were always being created from the database by get_eprint(). Objects are now "cached" as the parent of the sub-object, so we need to be more careful. This commit reduces the number of spurious commits() and revisions to the correct number for a document upload (i.e. one).

  * Reworded activation email a little.

  * Added phrase to put HTML wrapper around mail.
  * Email.pm uses HTML wrapper phrase.
  * Missed phrase in XML, tidied up file a bit.

  * Moved several bin/indexer functions into Index.pm
  * Added tick file (separate from pid file)
  * Added functions to Index.pm to allow start/stop from within EPrints (these call bin/indexer)

  * Converted all subs in cfg.d to be $c->{mysub} = sub
  * Converted Repository::call and can_call to handle this
  * Converted most &{...} calls to use Repository::call - some still need changing, but will need an alteration to the call method.

  * missed one
  * Added namespaces throughout lib
  * Converted system.xml

  [Christopher Gutteridge <cjg@ecs.soton.ac.uk>]
  * next release.
  * Fixed bug in install.pl.in which did a numerical compare when it should have been string compare.
  * Added plugins directory to the installer.
  * Made changes to tech_docs and makepackage to reflect new paths in eprint.org website.
  * New method $eprint->skip_validation which returns false unless the config option skip_validation is defined, in which case it is called as a function pointer and returns true if the eprint should _not_ be validated.
  * Added skip_validation test to all eprint & document validation routines.
  * Added commented-out skip_validation stub to the default ArchiveConfig.pm
  * Moved text for export-search results and cgi/export to phrases file.
  * export-results now offers only output modes for the current dataset.
  * Added method $eprint->render_export_links which returns a <ul> of all things an eprint an eprint can be output as.
  * Added multilang support to output/core_xml
  * Added "/perl/export" which exports an eprint in a named output format. If no format is specified, it lists legal formats.
  * Added method to all output plugins which returns the URL which will export a given dataobj in that format.
  * ** empty log message ***
  * Significant changes to SearchExpression:
  * Added documentation for many methods
  * perform_search now returns a SearchResults object.
  * cache_results, dispose, count, map, get_records and get_ids have been moved to SearchResults, but stubs have been left in SearchExpression to keep existing code working.
  * process_webpage has been split into several more subroutines to improve readability.
  * the search results now have two additional actions.
  * action=export_redir just redirects to the same URL but with a pretend filename suitable for the export format. eg. export_soton_xml.xml
  * action=export takes a serialised expression and a cacheid, and a output plugin id and exports the search results in that format. If the cacheid has expired then the search will be silently re-done.
  * SearchResults has an "export" method which calls an output plugin on the ressults.
  * Correction to $session->plugin_call - @array changed to %hash
  * New method $session->plugin_list. This returns the ids of available plugins, optionally filtered by various paramaters.
  * Commented out debug code in EPrints::Archive
  * New method $archive->plugin_list which returns the id's off all plugins available to the archive (not system plugins).
  * Commented out debug code in EPrints::Plugins
  * New subroutine: EPrints::Plugins::plugin_list() which returns the ids of all system level plugins.
  * added $dataobj->export method which exports a single dataobject using a single output plugin.
  * Public and staff search now ignore everything after a second slash. this makes /perl/search/simple/foo.txt legal. This is used to provide sane filenames when exporting via plugins.
  * XML Plugin now ensures utf8() of strings, so duff data will not produce an invalid file.
  * Fixed bug in $eprint->last_in_thread which reported a loop error, even when there wasn't one.

eprints (2.3.13.beta.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [Christopher Gutteridge <cjg@ecs.soton.ac.uk>]
  * preping 2.3.13.b.1
  * preparing for release
  * [#1089] The deprecated cache option warning in SearchExpression
  * >new now tells the file and line that passed the deprecated option.
  * [#1158] On user area page, begin new item, and items-in-workarea are now seperate boxes. The box with the items-in-workarea is now called "Undeposited Items".
  * Corrected a missing ; in eprints.css
  * [#1178] Editors may now not modify (edit) items in the buffer "deletion". They can undelete them and then modify them. There is a new config option allow_edit_deleted to turn off this restriction.
  * [#1164] When an editor removes an item from a user workarea the default email message is now different to the one sent when an eprint is removed from buffer.
  * [#1176] configure now checks for DBD::mysql
  * In "install.pl.in" renamed $c to $from_configure to make the code clearer.
  * Also renamed $syssettings to $system_settings_file for the same reason.
  * Added a subroutine set($$$$) to update simple system settings values, with an optional default if no value already exists or was provided.
  * [#1191][#1315] set() is now used to set smtp_server, enable-gdome, show_ids_in_log and apache.
  * [#1192] In an install (not upgrade), install.pl will warn if no value for smtp_server has been set.
  * test commit
  * Changed the message at the end of configure from "...to install" to "...to install/upgrade". Should be less worrying for people.
  * [#1167] When configure tests for a perl module is now says that it's a perl module. Before it said "looking for Apache2... no" which confused people
  * The configuration subroutines: "update_archived_eprint" and "update_submitted_eprint" are now only called by EPrints::EPrint if they exist. They are considered deprecated.
  * Added new configuration option, a function handle called "eprint_status_change" which, if it exists, is called each time an eprint successfully moves between buffers.
  * Removed "update_archived_eprint" and "update_submitted_eprint" from the default configuration.
  * Added method to EPrints::Archive, "can_call" which tests to see if it is possible to call a subroutine in the config. package.
  * Added method to EPrints::Archive. "try_call" which acts like "call" but first checks that it can can_call, and if not silently fails, rather than cause a perl error.
  * Added option "show_ids_in_log" which causes the id of the archive causing the log message to be prefixed to every line it logs. This can be set at the archive level, but is more useful in SystemSettings to control all archives.
  * [#1005] Code in EPrints.pm which handles threads now checks to make sure that loops don't exist. Before it just got into a tight loop and never exited! If a loop is detected then the code is exited and a warning is logged. If rendering a thread HTML list then a warning message is placed at the point the loop was detected.
  * [#1159] Fixed a bug which meant that edit_eprint would give a 500 error rather than a clean warning in the situation that no dataset was given AND the eprintid did not exist.
  * #1090 Cleaned up error messages to be less worrying when non-essential tools are missing.
  * fixed issue with not processing __LICENSE__ on some directories.
  * [#1182] Added default values to user fields "frequency" and "mailempty" this will stop new editors being bugged for values which should have sensible defaults.
  * [#1146] Added an empty phrase to the top of /cgi/latest in case people want to add an introduction.
  * [#1097] The any/all of these fields option is now hidden if there is only a single search field.
  * [#1210] Fixed typo.
  * Added new method EPrints::Utils::email_date which gives the current date and time encoded for an email header.
  * [#1290] Added Date: headers to both send_email_via_smtp and via_sendmail.
  * [#972] Caused indexer to reopen STDIN and STDOUT as /dev/null and the indexer log file - this prevents a warning about re-opening STDOUT as input etc.
  * [#1193] fixed spelling mistake in can't-send-email error.
  * cgi/users/status now uses $ds->render_name to show the name of the datasets in the last-indexed section.
  * Renamed "records" to "items" on default front page.
  * DataSet::get_sql_dataset_ids now just returns a hard wired array, rather than get it from $INFO. is_sql_dataset is now unneeded and removed.
  * Added new method $dataset->render_name which returns the name of this dataset (in the current language).
  * Corrections to terms in phrase file.
  * Renamed "records" to "items" on default front page.
  * [#862] Added an allow from all to the base html directory.
  * Changed PERL to Perl in information.xpage.
  * ** empty log message ***
  * [#1174] Made sure that "buffer" is titled correctly as "editorial buffer" in the user interface and configuration files.
  * [#1173] Replaced all occurrances of "archive" in user interface with "repository" instead. (except for self-archiving and open-archives)
  * Added new registration intro to archive-phrase-file so as not to change the message on existing archvies.

eprints (2.3.11.99.5-beta) unstable; urgency=low

  [Christopher Gutteridge <cjg@ecs.soton.ac.uk>]
  * commit for beta release
  * [#1025] Added missing phrase "lib/searchfield:help_itemref"
  * [#1027] Moved hard-wired "Continue" from Session.pm into the phrase file.
  * cgi/users/staff/edit_eprint used to assume the "archive" dataset if no dataset id was specified. Now it hunts through all datasets to find the item.
  * [#962] Added new option to staff/edit_eprint: Use as Template: called "copy" internally. This clones the eprint into the buffer but does not set the succeeds field and does not copy the documents. Nb. that the new version will have the same "userid" as the copied version, it does not currently get the userid from the editor who clones it.
  * [#962] "Use as Template" is available on eprints in all buffers. "New Version" is now only available on eprints in the "archive" or "deletion" buffers.
  * [#970] The script cgi/users/status now correctly checks that the user has the view-status priv.
  * [#982] The "whitedot" now loads of the https server if we are in https mode.
  * Modified $dataset->get_type_fields to log a warning if an unknown type is passed to it, and return [] rather than fail.
  * [#979] Added a new callback configuration option: sql_adjust. This takes an SQL string and returns a modifed version. It is called just before the SQL is passed to- the database.
  * Added test to detect if apache setting appears wrong. ie. If setting is for apache 1 but only mod_perl 2 is installed. If so print a helpful warning. [#1028]
  * misc.
  * [#876] New configuration option: allow_reset_password. If undefined it is assumed to be true. If set to false it causes the reset_password page to display a "this feature is disabled" message.
  * If you can't register via the web or reset passwords then set_password shows the same "feature disabled" message.
  * generate_apacheconf now causes the apache config to set an environment variable indicating the apache version it is intended for use with. If this ENV is set then it compares it to the setting in SystemSettings and if they don't match it prints a helpful error and quits. [#885]
  * code layout
  * When AnApache loads it checks to see if it can require the appropriate Apache or Apache2 module. If not it prints an error then sees if the other is available. If it is then it prints a suggestion that the SystemSettings param may be wrong.  [#884]
  * Value of secret fields now displays as [hidden] unless for some strange reason they are multiple, multilang or hasid. [#859]
  * Fixed bug: It was possible to select the "------" divide in set search form fields. [#853]
  * If no SMTP server is configured, and an attempt to send- mail via STMP is made, the system now logs a warning with advice on how to set the SMTP server. [#973]
  * removed test code from cgi/register
  * The deletion request on "cgi/users/review" now warns (via webpage) if the email did not get sent
  * The "cgi/users/change_email" form now warns (via webpage) if the email did not get sent.
  * The "cgi/reset_password" form now warns (via webpage) if the email did not get sent.
  * Changed the "email_failed" phrase to be generic as it will be used in several places.
  * added comments
  * Made the "problems" in the register page appear as css class problems (big red box). This way they are more obvious, and in the same style as problems in the submission form.
  * skipping testing apache 1.3 use's for now.
  * If cgi/register fails to send email, it removes the new user it just created and redisplays to registration form with a warning at the top. [#848]
  * Added a script to run all current tests in a harness.
  * Added warning to be sent to log if mail does not get sent correctly. [#848]
  * Fixed bug introduced in 2.3.7, EPrints would fail to set a mysql users password in mysql versions < 4.1 [#1010]
  * Render error now sends warnings to log when in online mode. [#841]
  * Fixed bug by adding code to ensure that $db->get_index_ids does not return any duplicates. [#841]
  * fixed incorrect attribute name in <style> elements in default template.
  * commented out some stray debug code in edit_eprint
  * Some initial tests. These will need much better planning as they grow.

  * Chopped up generate_views into subroutines a little - may be a bit clearer to understand now (maybe not).
  * Hacked the bundled Apache::DBI module to use log_error rather than log_reason (v1 and v2 mod_perl compliant)
  * The name of a language can now be specified in an language specific phrase file. Added a new method to session: render_language_name which renders the given name in the right language. Everywhere which mentions language names now uses this. Maybe set_lang should not.
  * Added a feature which looks for optional extra 'join' phrases to use in the first and/or last join of a sequence of values. ie. you can use name_join = ', ' and name_join.last = ' and '
  * Changed all Apache::exit's to just be exit's for apache 2 compatability.
  * Fixed bug in searches so that a single search on a multiple table can no longer return two instances of the same item (added a DISTINCT!)
  * Changed all remaining occurances of "iso-latin-1" to "iso-8859-1"
  * Added a fix to mkdir to make sure that the dir string is not a Unicode::String (as this causes an error).
  * Updated copyright statement to 2004!
  * XML to_string function now correctly handles <!-- comments -->
  * ordervalue for an undefined int is now "" (was causing warning)
  * ** empty log message ***

  * Fixed a bug in 'lang' when $multilingual options are set to true
  * Added escaping for cachecodes in database. a ' could cause an SQL error before.

  * Metafields are now dynamically loaded modules, don't need to 'use' them.

  [Christopher Gutteridge <cjg@ecs.soton.ac.uk>]
  * [c] Added submission_long_types config option and made the default true.
  * [doc] New config options allow_user_checkout_eprint and submission_long_types.
  * [c] Changed default pin timeout number from 3 hours to a week!
  * - [c] Messed around with the citations file. Will need to be cleaned up before next release.
  * - [c] Messed around with the metadata-types file. Will need cleanup.
  * Changed latex2png so that it no longer spawns a cat command using backticks, but does it all in Perl instead.
  * [api] Changed occurances of $user->get_eprints to be $user->get_owned_eprints in "user_eprints" & "home" so that eprints related, but not directly submitted by someone appear as theres too.
  * Started work on "checkout" option to allow people to remove their items from the archive and edit them. Not 100% sure of the interface & rules yet.
  * [doc] New config option "submission_stage_last_for_staff_edit" which indicates if the last page of the submission format is different to normal (files) so that people swapping the order of fields won't break the staff edit mode.
  * - [doc] Added support for "paged" input of metadata, indicated by a <page /> tag in metadata-types. Still needs to be made to look nicer.
  * [doc] When getting fields from citations or $obj->get_value, qualifiers such as .id or .res=D are now allowed.
  * [doc] Added support for data resolutions. min_resolution and max_resolution. min_resolution is the resolution Y/M/D which must be entered. max_resolution is the resolution which is returned from get_value(s) etc. (This can be set "on the fly" with submission.res=Y style qualifiers.
  * Date search improved to handle YYYY-YYYY, YYYY-MM-, -YYYY-MM-DD etc. not just (YYYY-MM-DD)?|(-(YYYY-MM-DD)?)? but (YYYY(-MM(-DD)?)?)?|(-(YYYY(-MM(-DD)?)?)?)? (sheesh)
  * added page_order, staff_pages and pages instance variables to dataset.
  * [doc] Added new input_style for sets and datatype fields: "long" which renders them as a <dl> list with radio buttons.
  * Fixed a '\n' to be "\n" instead in an error in Archive.pm
  * New function: @fields = $ds->get_page_fields( $type, $page, $staff )
  * New function: @pages = $ds->get_type_pages( $type );
  * [db] Database now stores date 2000 as 2000-00-00 (which is the mysql way. This is not super portable, but hey.
  * New function:  EPrints::Database::trim_date( $mysql_date )
  * New function:  EPrints::Database::pad_date( $mysql_date, [$inc] )
  * These functions convert from eprints date format to mysql and back (strip/add -00's).
  * in Document.pm, changed "cp" to "/bin/cp" which is still a touch flakey as it's shelling out, but is an absolute path and avoids some problems on securer systems.
  * in EPrints.pm changed an "if defined $obj->get_value(x)" to "if $obj->is_set(x)"
  * - New function: $eprint->validate_meta_page( $page, [$for_archive] ) for validating each page of the meta data entry (so you don't have to wait until the end). * does not have a callback yet *
  * Now the render_latex function removes trailing whitespace if any is left over after it's shenanigens (it was adding a single space on the end which screwed up citations.)
  * - [api] New function: $xhtml = $field->render_help( $session ) now used in preference to display_help. ** maybe display_help can be removed? **
  * Improved rendering of date type so that it renders at it's max_resolution.
  * - Added a really odd hack to editperms so that it only shows extra input boxes if explicitly clicked. That can't be right!
  * Added a charset = utf-8 to textarea input fields.
  * Made it so that a field of type search with a "null" search is now considered unset, lots of empty searches were getting stored.
  * Made the "EX" search flag mean nothing for date fields. This might be changed later, but for now means that 1999 = 1999-09-01 even in "EX" mode.
  * - Fiddled with "height" code for pick lists. It's still not right.
  * - hacked "DOCTYPES" into the top of pages. Gotta be a better way.
  * [api] new option to submission forms: $autosend. This causes the form to store the resultant XHTML for the next page of the form in a way that can be requested, rather then render it right away as a page.
  * submission form now uses $user->is_owner($eprint) to establish ownership, rather than checking that user submitted it.
  * Added a couple of lines to Subscription.pm to deal with the fact that mailempty might not be defined (gets rid of a warning)
  * [api][doc] Changed  $user->get_owned_eprints() to be $thing->get_owned_eprints( $dataset ). Now returns all the eprints created by that user, in that dataset. UNLESS the config option "get_users_owned_eprints" is set in which case it calls that as a function and returns the result of that instead.
  * Improved field_from_config_string so that it can now have any number of qualifications after a fieldname, if desired. eg. foo.main.res=Y (not sure why you'd want to, but let's keep it rebust eh?)
  * - New function:  EPrints::XML::write_xhtml_file( $node, $filename ) this outputs the node just like write_xml_file but prints a DOCTYPE at the top. Bit of a hack really.
  * (in tools/update_phrase_file) improved the layout of the translation flagging and the flags now include the reference code.

  * removed render_subject_desc from Session. It's never used.
  * fixed bug in searchexp unserialise, which did not set fields in the target exp to null if they were not mentioned in the serial- ised version. This caused defaults to appear again when you select "refine search".

  * <securehost> and <securepath> are now optional (in archive.xml)
  * Fixed a bug in the 2.1->2.2 SQL in bin/upgrade
  * whatever.
  * changed editperms in User.pm to be a multiple field, and made changes where this is used. Each search is "OR" not "AND". Changed "upgrade" to add the table (rather than just a field).
  * eprints no longer have a "hash" value after all. It's just stored in the XML files.
  * Fixed OAI2 bug which meant it did not complain when identifiers did not match the oai regexp. Should now, finally, be 100% compliant.
  * Some improvements to the archive loader, should hopefully express more errors in the perl config modules.
  * the from_buffer method in Database now takes offset, count and justids params as used elsewhere.
  * Added Probity.pm which hashes files and outputs in the probity XML format.
  * Document rehash() now uses Probity.pm everytime any document modifying method is called.
  * export_hashes now works with the XML probity format. (.xsh)
  * Added phrases for seperators in multiple value rendering (eg. the " and " in name lists. Searches are seperated by " <strong>OR<strong> "

  * SearchExpressions now always call from_buffer with the offset, count and justids, if set.
  * Fixed icky error in SearchField::item_matches which halted if a subject no longer exists for some reason. Now logs an warning and muddles on.

  * [c] Added skip_buffer config option which makes articles go from the work area directly to the archive.
  * [c] Default abstract page now lists eprint type.
  * [c] Default render_user_full now lists subscriptions too.
  * fixed typo in cgi/confirm s/timepout/timeout/
  * fixed bug in MD5 hash code and added hook to use different hash if required.
  * [c] override default hash method.

  * [c] Fixed ArchiveConfig.pm so that a user can always view a document they deposited even if it's secure.
  * Added regexp to make_text to remove all characters < ord(32) except 0x09, 0x0a and 0x0d. They're not legal in XML!
  * Modified the selection field renderer so that if the specified height is 2 or more, the actual height will always be at least 2. (so it does not become a pull-down).
  * Fixed a bug in SubmissionForm so that "cancel" on the "eprinttype" page does not store any change in type.
  * Added a "submit later" button to Deposit Page.
  * Changed the submission form "thanks" page to mention that it is awaiting approval by an editor.
  * Fixed an error in "lib/userform:blurb" phrase which linked to set_email rather than change_email.
  * Added google_site which appends "site:whatever.com" to a search param and redirects that search to google.

  * [conf] Added editperms and related fields to metadata-types.xml
  * generate_views can now do "name" fields. Name fields are "browse-able"
  * [doc] notimestamp & hideempty are new paramaters to views.
  * Editor alerts: mailed out at same time as subscription to tell what editors have in the "buffer".
  * Subject editors: editors may now be properly limited to a search set.
  * phrases generation now is more careful about garbage collection. Esp. unused pin values.
  * [api] render_input_field has new optional param: $staff which is used to render id fields with the id_editors_only condtional. Also in render_input_form to pass through.
  * SubmissionForm and UserForm tell render_input_form if they are in staff mode.
  * [doc] New metadata fields:
  * id_editors_only for has_id fields to show the "id" input bit to editors only or everyone?

  * [api] Removed set_value from SearchField (not used)
  * Changed the phrase for mailing subscriptions to be one big phrase so layout change is possible.
  * added to User.pm: $thing->send_out_editor_alert and EPrints::User::process_editor_alerts( $session, $frequency );
  * changed email encoding for latin from iso-latin-1 to iso-8859-1 probably make no difference.
  * EPrints::XML::dom can now take a list of types, not just one.
  * Improved EPrints::XML::to_string to make <br/> into <br />
  * [api] Added EPrints::XML to handle abstraction of XML::DOM/XML::GDOME

  * [api] MetaField objects no longer know what dataset they belong to.
  * [api] removed $metafield->get_dataset() and $metafield->set_dataset()
  * [api] $metafield->get_values( $session ) is now $metafield->get_values( $session, $dataset )
  * [api] $archive->parse_xml( $filename, %config ) is now $archive->parse_xml( $filename, $no_expand ) as %config was XML::DOM specific.
  * [api] EPrints::Config::parse_xml() removed. Use EPrints::XML functions instead.
  * DataSet now caches configurations so that it can share the same configur- ation between inbox,buffer,archive,deletion and eprint which saves a chunk of RAM.
  * DataSet now keeps track of which fields are required for a type, rather than cloning MetaFields and setting their required property.
  * [api] To find out if a metafield is required within a specific type of eprint there is a new DataSet method $boolean = $ds->field_required_in_type( $field, $type ) the field property now just indicates if it is globally required.
  * [api] The Database method  $db->get_values( $field ) is now $db->get_values( $field, $dataset )
  * [api] $field->render_input_field now additionally takes optional parameters of $dataset, $type which if defined will be used to see if the field is required for the specified type when rendering it.
  * $session now keeps a handle on a document {doc} in addition to the current page {page} which must be owned by {doc}.
  * [api] $session->new_page() is removed (and no longer required)
  * [api] two new options for $session->render_input_form: field & type which if set will be passed to render_input_field (see above).
  * [api] $session->take_ownership removed. Use clone_for_me instead.
  * [api] New method for $session: $session->clone_and_own( $node, $deep ) which clones the specified node, but owned by the sessions own document (and thus can be part of the output page). If $deep is 0 then only the node is cloned and not it's children too.
  * [api] Please use EPrints::XML::to_string( $node ) rather than $node->toString as in GDOME this does not work properly on DocumentFragments
  * Fixed a bug in oai2 which meant it occasionally used the wrong session in munge_date.
  * [c] some mess ups to the default views (need to fix before release)
  * new method: EPrints::DataSet::get_sql_dataset_ids which returns an array of all the datasets which map directly into sets of SQL tables. This is used by create tables to get the list.
  * Added check to bin/create_tables to check if there are more than 32 fields requiring SQL Indexes in the main table.
  * Added a --force option to bin/create_tables to override warnings.
  * Added option to bin/generate_abstract to generate a single abstract.
  * Added PerlFreshRestart to apache conf from generate_apacheconf to make apache reload the perlmodules and eprints config on apache reload.
  * "options" to timestamp subject views and to only show subjects which have 1 or more things in them. Although they are not yet options, they soon will be.
  * added new system metadata field to document: "hash" which contains the MD5 of the files in the document. bin/upgrade will now add it to v2.1 databases.
  * [c] added default values for searches. New config options advanced_search_defaults & simple_search_defaults which are references to hashes. Does not handle things like "ANY/ALL" just the text.
  * Tidied up bin/status to look nicer and also have report on subscriptions how many of each frequency and when the last mailing for that frequency was.
  * Archive config now remebers when it was last changed and if /archvies/FOO/cfg/.changed has changed since then it reloads the archive.
  * Now does "do" rather than "require" on ArchiveConfig.pm so that it can be repeated to reload the module.
  * Some code in Config.pm tries to change UID to "eprints" (or whatever) if running as root. But it does not work properly as the code gets "tainted".
  * Added a much clearer warning when errors in the config modules are encountered.
  * Added count_indexes to DataSet which returns how many SQL indexes are required for the main table of that dataset.
  * Added rehash function to Document, which recalculates the hash of the files in the document (the will later be overridable with a config opion). All functions which add or remove files to the document now call rehash.
  * [c] Added new metadata field property (sql_index). Which defaults to true but if set to zero will supress the field having an SQL index.
  * Fixed bugs in OpenArchives code which used OAI v1.1 id for part of OAI2.0
  * Fixed display bug: Buttons are now rendered in their own little <div>.
  * Cleaned up submission form for the case where there are NO required formats.
  * Subscriptions now obey "MailEmpty"? or not field.
  * Fixed bug in subscriptions which made them mail out multiple times.
  * Sucessful sending of subscriptions for a frequency cause a file called /opt/eprints2/archive/FOO/cfg/subscription-FREQUENCY.timestamp the timestamp of which is used in the archive "status" page.
  * Added $subscription->get_last_timestamp($session,$frequency) which gives a neat interface to that value.
  * Fixed a view in User.pm where the URL for a given user was wrong (eprint 1 URL)
  * Added code which won't get documented just yet to citation renderer which processes @year@ in an ATTRIBUTE of a citation like it would &year; eg. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?v=@year@+papers+from">&year;</a>
  * Added Utils::get_timestamp which returns a neat time stamp string, similar to that from UNIX date command.
  * [c] Increased default results page size to 100 from 10.
  * [c] Increased default witdth of abstract input to 90 cols.
  * [c] Increased default number of author input fields to 6.
  * [c] Some tweaks to default citations.
  * [c] Made "publication" field optional in all types.
  * [c] Added a new config file to archives - apachevhost.conf - which is included into the configuration inside the virutalhost definition.
  * Modified apacheconf rewrite rules so that a trailing "/" is not required to get record abstract pages.
  * Modified generate_views so that files for values which contain " " or "/" have "_" in their stead.
  * [db] Added new system fields to the database. DB version is now 2.2. bin/upgrade will make the changes. Changes are:
  * in dataset "subscription"
  * add a new boolean field "mailempty"
  * in dataset "user"
  * remove the field "editorsubjects"
  * add the following fields: + editperms (search) + mailempty (boolean) + frequency (set)
  * [c] New configuration option "catch404" which may be undefined, but may be a reference to a subroutine which takes ($session, $url) and returns either a new URL to redirect to or undef if it's really a 404. This is to handle migration from eprints 1 or other systems.
  * [c] New "priv" for users: "no_edit_own_record" which actually removes the edit my record option from the user page (for DB's where the users are imported not web-registered.)
  * Edit subscriptions page now includes extra option to indicate if a user wants a mail when there are zero matches.
  * Changed the layout of the subscriptions summary page to be a bit clearer.
  * Added a check in get_conf to prevent null reference errors in the case of an optional hash table. Eg $c->{a} = { c=>4, b=>5 } OR $c->{a} = undef; and someone requests $archive->get_conf( "a", "c" ) - will return "4" in 1st case and undef in the 2nd.
  * [c] Added new metadata parameter "can_clone" which defaults to 1. If set to 0 then the field is not cloned when the record containing it is cloned.
  * added a test to prevent a warning when unserialising an undefined value as a search expression (and treat it like an empty string).
  * fixed bug in SubmissionForm. Now only lists the required formats, and asks for at least one if there is at least one required format.
  * added some checks to render_name in Utils.pm to avoid warnings in the case of undefined values.
  * fixed render_citation so that it should now not crash on nested <isset> elements.
  * Added PNGs to replace GIFs for logos in the static/image directory.
  * [c] Made stylesheet link in the default template link to the full URL rather than relative link. Eeep. That's not going to work - it'll give an error. Dammit.
  * [c] Added 2 new archive config settings: securehost and securepath for running https.
  * generate_apacheconf now generates all the apache confs (does not take an archive id, anymore). Also now generates extra auto file to be Include'd into a sercure virtualhost config. Played around with the config file which gets generated to make it work both secure & not.
  * tweak to /perl/users/home to make change_user work on secure setting.
  * made the Auth.pm module accept /00/00/00/00/00/ format document paths for authentications in addition to /0000000/00/. (needed for https mode).
  * Fixed ANOTHER minor issue in OAI2 code. At the end of a List there should have been (and now is) an empty resumptionToken.
  * New method added to MetaField: list_values. This takes flattens out multilang, multiple and non-multiple fields so that a list of values of that field is returned.
  * To avoid an error in oai, if datestamp is not set, datestamp now defaults to 0001-01-01.
  * SearchExpresion->dispose now does not try and dispose an undefined tmptable.
  * new method in SearchExpression: item_matches. This takes an item of the type appropriate for the search and returns true if the search expression matches on that item. Also a item_matches method on SearchField used by the one in SearchExpression.
  * [c] removed all the darn GIF's. Set a CSS "style" on the 1x1 image in searchforms to "display: none". Also it now links to a PNG instead. Also updated the "information" page a bit more. Removed GIF's from default homepage too.
  * new function is Utils.pm: is_in which takes searches in a list for items in a second list. Two modes: success if one found or success if all found.

  [Christopher Gutteridge <cjg@ecs.soton.ac.uk>]
  * ** empty log message ***
  * Fixed bug in render_ruler : it failed to take ownership of the new fuler.
  * Added more details into "information" page in default config. And a GNU linking to gnu.org.
  * Fixed some typos.
  * Gone back to using configure! Almost works expcept generated install.pl file is not executable!
  * Added Uni Copyright info.
  * Getting docs ready for v2.1 Now does TEXINFO docs
  * Added "submission_stages" config to allow override of order of SubmissionForms
  * Loosened regexp for passwords in configure_archive (now allows upper case too)
  * [c] Added new SystemSettings option: "virtualhost" which is now used by generate_apacheconf as the NameVirtualHost value (or "*" if it's not set)
  * Added page id's to each build_page so that stuff can be hooked onto them.
  * generate_views now orders the index page (using results from get_values) unless it's a view of multiple combined fields in which case it does not.
  * bin/upgrade turns the "commentary", "replacedby" and "succeeds" in the tables "archive","deletion","inbox" and "buffer" from VARCHAR to INTEGER. These fields should have been INT's in the first place. This is done as root. bin/upgrade now makes a root dbh connection if needed. The origional values of the fields are dumped to /tmp first in case of disaster.
  * [c] Added new metafield configs: make_value_orderkey and make_single_value_orderkey which can be used to override the normal orderkey generation - eg. could turn field with format "4.9d" into key "00000004.00000009d" that will sort alphabetically correctly.
  * Now correctly generates orderkeys for subjects sets and datatype's fields.
  * year orderkeys now pad 6 not 4 (just in case)
  * removed code which always put <a name="t"></a> at the top of pages when an "internal" button was pushed. This broke the whole idea of the #t jump to where you were before.
  * sigh
  * Now oai 2.0 Compliant.
  * [conf] Added an oai2 oai_dc XML render function to ArchiveOAIConfig.pm AND added oai2 config section for keeping namespaces etc seperate.
  * [db] Added subscriptions! including a send_subscriptions bin script, a cgi page to edit them (subscribe) and added the link to the user home page.
  * added a new bin script: "upgrade" which upgrades the database tables to the latest version. (sorts out the subscription tables for 2.0->2.1)
  * [db] added a new db id counter - subscriptionid
  * turned _create_table in Database.pm into create_dataset_tables so that upgrade could use it.
  * fixed a bug in the sql escaping code - escaped '.' when it didn't have to.
  * added a whole bunch of $sth->finish commands to clean up more after db functions to hopefully reduce memory leaks.
  * added "version" concept to the database tables to reflect what version of eprints they are suitable for the automatic "upgrade" script. Database.pm gained: create_version_table, set_version, has_table, get_tables, get_version, is_latest_version.
  * session now uses "is_latest_version" to check the DB is ok and reports a different warning if the "archive" tables exists. (wrong version vs. no tables.)
  * SearchExpressions can now be rendered into a screenable description using
  * >render_description - SearchField also gained a render_description which is called by the SearchExpression method.
  * MetaField gained "make_searchexp" which is only legal on search type fields and returns the searchexp described by the given value.
  * Fixed a typo in the message about not having a top-level-subject.
  * Added a hack to SearchExpression which gets the fields for a search-type field from the subscription_fields conf setting if the property is set to "subscriptionfields" rather than an array.
  * SearchExp again; made render_order_menu a seperate function so that it can be used when rendering a inlined searchexp (eg. for a search-type-field)
  * SearchExp and SearchField no longer return the bad words from a search. This is now handled by putting the searchexp description at the top of the search results page as part of the "blurb" which now lays out the data about the search (so you can change the order, eg. Timing info first, or even not at all)
  * added set_property to SearchExpression so that you can change properties of an existing searchexpression. Useful to set use_oneshot_cache on a searchexp created from de-serialising.
  * Added "pagehook" feature to allow certain pages to have extra body attibutes and "stuff" in the top of the head and body elements. For javascript. Mostly for Steve Harris in AKT.
  * Added "pageid"'s to all the submission form pages.
  * [c] Added examples of pagehooks to config.
  * added an "export_as_xml" attribute to fields which defaults to true but if false then the field is not exported in an XML dump - now used by subject to supress dumping ancestors.
  * fixed bug in abort() which attempted to report to the apache request while under modperl even at startup (so no request -> error ).
  * Added POD Documentation for Language.pm, Latex.pm, MetaField.pm
  * Added xhtml-entities.dtd to system cfg dir - contains all XHTML entites such as &nbsp; - these are now included in the archive dtd files which means that &nbsp; &euro; etc. now work in phrase files, the template and the static pages but NOT the citations.
  * staff eprint edit now updates the eprints static page if needed.
  * added "layout" option to views configuration. Allows <p>, <ul> or <ol> style lists. A custom citation no longer automatically turns off the <p> wrapper.
  * [api] changed syntax of EPrints::Eprint->new so that the optional param "dataset" is now the last option. This means that it can be called exactly like any other EPrints::DataObj->new (which is neater). Updated all uses of this call in the code.
  * [conf] changed call to EPrints::EPrint->new in the commenarty bit of ArchiveRenderConfig
  * [api] EPrints::EPrint::create() - removed the "userid" parameter which must now be set seperately. Updated all the code to reflect this change.
  * Removed $EPrints::EPrint::id_code_digits and hardwired it to "8" as I've got no intentions of changing it and other parts of the code already assume 8.
  * Added POD documentation to Document.pm , EPrint.pm , ImportXML.pm and RequestWrapper.pm
  * Removed DIGITS from Document and hardwired occurances to 2.
  * Added render_xhtml_field to Utils.pm - this acts as a special field renderer like the one in Latex.pm (but renders as XML).
  * added pod docs for Database.pm
  * Added pod templates for comments to all subroutines!
  * Added pod docs to Archive.pm Auth.pm Config.pm Dataset.pm
  * "search" metadata fields now work - rendering form and from the form.
  * removed {datasetname} from DataSet - replaced it with {id}
  * also in DataSet renamed {typeorder} to {type_order} and {stafftypes} to {staff_types}
  * added an optional prefix to searchexpression cgi field ids, so that more than one can appear in a single form.
  * changed $searchfield->get_form_name to ->get_id which returns an id for that searchfield in the expression (without the CGI prefix)
  * added is_blank method to searchexpression and searchfield which returns true if there is no conditions for searchexp or for searchfield if it does not have a condition.
  * added from_string method to searchexp which unserialises the string and applies the "safe" parts. Does not add any new searchfields or change the dataset.
  * [config] some test stuff added to default config. Should be removed before next release. (metadata types & fields)
  * removed a number of doubled-up => symbols in scripts.
  * POD doc'd DataObj
  * Added 'search' metafield type. Does not work fully yet.
  * in search expression, split the part which renders the actual search fields from the search page renderer. This allows it to be called by the search field type input form renderer.
  * 20/05/2002
  * [config] changed "Contact site admin" text at bottom of page template to look less like an order (people thought it indicated an error)
  * added --silent as a synonym for --quiet - part of GNU regs.
  * added --version option to all command line options to print command name, EPrints release version and license.
  * fixed bug in cgi/oai - from and until were ignored!
  * added an option to SystemSettings; disable_df. This makes cgi/status and the create EPrints subroutine skip looking at disk-free.
  * metafield now returns the text of a text field as its value label. It returned an error before!
  * added EPrints::Utils::cmd_version($progname) to automate generation of
  * -version outputs.
  * changed syntax of image quoting locspecs in VLit module.
