=item B<archive>
 
 EPrints::Archive

An archive is a eprints archive with it's own website configuration and data. One install of the eprints software can run serveral seperate archives. Sharing code but with totally different configurations.

=item B<archive>
 
 EPrints::Session

A session is created every time a cgi script or a bin script is executed, and terminated afterwards. 

=item B<eprint>
 
 EPrints::EPrint

An eprint is a record in the system which has one or more I<documents> and some I<metadata>. Usually, more than one I<document> is to provide the same information in multiple formats, although this is not compulsary.

=item B<document>

 EPrints::Document

A document is a single format of an I<eprint>, eg. HTML, PDF, PS etc. It can contain more than one file, for example HTML may contain more than one html page + image files. The actual files are stored in the filesystem.

=item B<user>

 EPrints::User

A user registered with the system. (NOT necesarily the author of the I<eprints> they deposit).

=item B<subject>

 EPrints::Subject

A I<subject> has an id and a list of who it's parents are. There is a build in I<subject> with the id "ROOT" to act as the top level. A subject can have more than one parent to allow you to create a rich lattice, rather than just a tree, but loops are not allowed.

=item B<type> or B<usertype> or B<eprinttype>

I<users>, I<eprints> and I<documents> all have a "type". This controls how they are "cited" and also for I<users> and I<eprints> it controls what I<fields> may be edited, and which are required.

=item B<dataobj> or B<item>

 EPrints::DataObj

The "super class" of I<subjects>, I<users>, I<eprints> and I<documents>. In the very core of the system these are all treated identically and much of the configuration and methods of these classes of "thing" are identical. We use the term I<item> to speak about the general case.

=item B<dataset>

 EPrints::DataSet

A dataset is a collection of I<items> of the same type. It can be searched.

Core datasets are:
 
 DATASET ID | TYPE     | COMMENT
            |          |
 inbox      | eprint   | Eprints which users are still working on.
 buffer     | eprint   | Eprints submitted for editorial approval.
 archive    | eprint   | Eprints live in the archive.
 deletion   | eprint   | Eprints which have been deleted from the archive.
 user       | user     | Users registered.
 subject    | subject  | The subject tree or lattice.
 document   | document | The documents belonging to ALL 
            |          | eprints in the system.

=item B<database>

 EPrints::Database

The connection to the MySQL back end. I<datasets> are stored in the MySQL system, but you do not have to address it directly.

=item B<fields> or B<metadata fields>

 EPrints::MetaField

A single field in a dataset. Each dataset has a few "system" fields which eprints uses to manage the system and then any number of I<archive> specific fields which you may configure.
