eprints.org software history

2000-07-04 - Beta-1 Released


2000-09-29 - Beta-2 Released.

Changes in core code:

- Slight directory restructure. No longer need symlink into
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl (or equivalent), use "PERL5LIB" environment variable
instead. This is cleaner, and allows >1 eprints service to run on a single
machine more easily.
- Now refers to "deposits" rather than "submissions", to avoid journal
connotations.
- Minor fix to e-mail parsing code in bin/process_mail.
- Staff couldn't edit eprints in submission buffer, this resulted in an error.
Fixed.
- Flawed disk space calculation fixed.
- Now uses URI::Heuristic to improve Web grabbing flexibility
- Better guessing of "show first" file during Web grabbing
- No longer prepends "Clone of" to titles of cloned eprints - this caused
confusion and people tended to leave it in
- Can now add elements to the <HEAD> segment of Web pages
- Search script now easier to call externally. Now assumes that if any
parameters are passed in, a search should be attempted. This makes it easy to
add "quick search" forms or standard searches to other (possibly external) Web
pages.
- In the "threads" of eprint versions and commentaries/responses, the date at
which each was deposited is now displayed.
- Slight rewording around these "threads" to make them easier to understand.
- Cleaned up Open Archives interface in anticipation of new protocol. Current
version still only exports OAMS, however.
- Changed "spec" field subscription table to be "multitext" rather than "text"
(in MySQL, TEXT instead of VARCHAR(255)). Some specs turned out to be longer
than 255 characters long and so weren't stored correctly.
- Various updates to on-line help.
- Open Archives exported metadata now properly encoded in UTF-8, using
Unicode-String module.

Site default configuration changes:

- Added references metadata field to eprints. This can be used by automatic
citation linkers in the future.
- Added "expertise" metadata field to user records.
- Fixed errors in automatic reply to unrecognised autoadmin message.
- Fixed error in user introduction message.
- Made it clearer how to set up with a non-standard port.
- Can specify multiple metadata formats for export via open archives protocols;
however, N.B. current (Santa Fe) core code will only at present handle "OAMS".
- Minor fixes to reference renderings.
- Now ensures authors enter scheme (e.g. "http:" when they enter their "home
page URL". Too many authors were entering just e.g. "www.foo.bar", meaning the
link didn't work.
- No longer insists for page and volume numbers for "unpublished" or "in press"
journal papers.
- Changes to wording in default Web pages, including a couple of HTML syntax
fixes.


2000-11-29 Version 1.0 released

- Added autoconf, makefile-based automatic installation procedure, which checks
for prerequisite software, and optionally creates the MySQL database, creates a
crontab, and (experimentally) updates the Apache configuration. It also sets up
Perl path information in the parameters to the scripts in bin/, and adds "use
lib" code to the scripts in cgi/, so you don't have to mess around setting
PERL5LIB before running the offline scripts.
- Better handling of URLs with special characters in (brackets, spaces etc.).
Saved to the local server unescaped, and the URLs are rendered escaped.
- generate_static now copies everything across from the static/ directory to
html/, not just the .html files. This means that image files etc. should be
placed in the static/ directory rather than the html/ directory; the html/
directory can now be considered to be entirely automatically generated.
- Clicking on a result from a staff eprint search now links to a page with
options to remove the eprint, or move the eprint back into the submissions
buffer.
- In the depositing interface, checkboxes that are required fields are no
longer rendered with an asterisk, as this was misleading; users sometimes
thought that it meant they had to check the box.
- Added update_laf script to make changing the site look and feel easy. It just
runs generate_static, generate_abstracts and generate_views.
- Added an extra database table to store information about eprints removed from
the archive. This is necessary in order to able to support the forthcoming new
Open Archives protocol. It also has other holds information about a replacement
eprint in the archive if it exists. Removing an eprint automatically creates a
deletion record in this table.
- Staff status page now shows number of deleted eprints.
- If user enters the ID of a deleted record in the box on the front page (or
wherever else the site decides to put one), they're told the eprint has been
deleted and where a replacement is if one exists.
- Added a "404 Document Not Found" HTTP error handler that:
  + can detect attempted accesses to deleted eprints, and display an
    appropriate message, with a link to a newer version of the eprint in the
    archive if it exists
  + can make guesses about slightly mistyped accesses to eprint files,
    providing a link to the abstract page
  + renders other 404 errors with the nice site skin and a friendly message.
- Software now uses local time instead of GMT for all datestamping etc. (This
required changing one "gmtime" to "localtime"!)
- Supports new-style open archives identifiers (as well as older, Santa
Fe-style)
- Fixed bug in subscriptions: If user selected "must fulfill ANY of these
conditions" in their subscription parameters, and selected some search terms or
subjects, those terms would be OR'd with the date specification that limits the
search to the last day, week or month. Thus, they'd be mailed a fair chunk of
the archive on a regular basis. Fixed this by removing the "must fulfill
ANY/ALL" option from subscriptions; adapting the SearchExpression code to cope
with a special case would have introduced too much complexity.
- Added a "401 Authorisation Required" HTML page. Now when an incorrect
username/password is entered, the user is shown some useful information about
how to register or be reminded of their username/password if they've forgotten.
- Added "erase_archive" script to wipe database and eprints files in one fell
swoop. Useful for people setting an archive up and playing around with metadata
sets. Asks for confirmation, just in case an inadvertent double click (etc.)
would result in the wiping of a large amount of live data....
- Removed defined(@array) occurrences, they trigger warnings in perl 5.6.0,
deprecated behaviour.
- Updated the on-line help.

Site default configuration changes

- Moved code for displaying versioning and commentary trees on the abstract
page to the site default configuration code.
- Added $for_staff parameter to EPrintSite::SiteRoutines::eprint_render_full().
- Added warnings at the top of each abstract page if the currently viewed
eprint is not the latest version of that eprint in the archive.
- Likewise, an eprint which is the most recent of multiple versions in the
archive is clearly labelled as such.
- Minor fix to rendering of conference proceedings references.
- Added "description" field to site information
- In preparation for new Open Archives protocol, added oai_base_url parameter
to SiteInfo.pm.
- Also added Dublin Core mapping for default metadata set.
- Added hook to site information for agreement text (e.g. copyright breach
disclaimer) when users deposit records.


###########################
   PRE-RELEASE CHANGES
###########################
- Added the findfiles.pl script as part of removing GNU-specific commands from
the makefile. Used it to replace "find -maxdepth 1 -type f".
- Replaced occurances of "cp -a" in Makefile with "tar" to increase portability.
- configure: GROUP and USER no longer conditional on FULL_INSTALL
- top level dir of EPrints package renamed from "eprints" to "eprints-version-whatever"
- renamed oai-0.2 to oai (now supports oai 1.0)
- minor changes to OpenArchives.pm
- added debug=yes option to oai. This makes it output text/plain rather than text/xml
