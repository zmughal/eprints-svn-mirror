GNU EPrints README

The documentation for EPrints can be found in the docs/ directory. 

Documentation is available in the following formats:
  * Plain Text
  * PDF (Adobe Portable Document Format)
  * Postscript - formatted with 2 manual pages per side to save paper when 
           printing.
  * HTML
  * INFO 
  * TEXINFO

If you want to install without reading the documentation (are you nuts?) you
can run:

 ./configure
 ./install.pl
