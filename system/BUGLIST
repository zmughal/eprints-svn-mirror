======================================================================
Known Bugs & Issues in latest EPrints-2 release
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
General
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- "clone eprint" function appears to break later version field

- No subjects at all causes a HTTP error. Possibly due to the top 
   subject for a field not existing.

- does not appear to remove eprint from ordervalues table if it is
   removed.

- passwords set via the web are not crypted until they are accepted.
(No loss of security from eprints-1 but annoying)

- Latex image cache will break if image tex has more than 127 chars
due to filename limit of 255 chars.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rendering
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- /views/ pages do not correctly sort the list of fields (it's done 
   by ID not the rendered phrase). 

- tree_to_utf8 for emails does not appear to be wrapping on 80 chars
like it's supposed to.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Apache Configuration & Page Serving
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- cgi directories can be viewed. The list directory contents option 
   should be off.

- CGI scripts are ALL set to be no cache. Would be nice if some were
   not but this may cause other problems...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Searching
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Web based search failing to use the cache.

- Web based Searches sometimes displays ALL results when it should 
   be paged.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EPrints Submission Form
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- doc upload page does not give a sensible message when there are no 
   documents.

- If you select a file to upload (in submission form) but click back then
   it still uploads the file then discards it (which can be annoying if it's
   big) Back buttons should be in a seperate form.

- .tar.gz and ZIP don't work in demoprints archive. Due to the "upgrade"
   install mode failing to preserve the "executables" field.

- capturing a website with a ~ in the URL set the wrong filename in the 
   documents data. (didn't handle %'s right?)

- weird bug with multiple languages that they move the values around when
   you hit "more languages". Possily due to bad "squash up" code.

- no way to unselect a month (set) when it's not multiple. OK for required
   fields but bad otherwise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Regexp for hostnames does not allow "-" signs



FIXED: 15/01
- SearchExpression appears to be running SQL from searchfields even 
   on a cached result. [this was due to the fact that caching was
   done in the get method not the perform_search method]
- multiple languages support broken: can't make "ordervalues" tables
   [this was due to swapping from one ordervalues table for all langs
   to one PER lang without testing fully]

FIXED: 20/01
- freetext searches were dropping the last result for each word.

FIXED: 26/01
- form buttons are not all displayed in a sensible order, eg "Next","Prev"
- Back button should not be the default button on file upload pages. 
- default action is always first button in form. (Which if I fix the button 
   ordering problem will mean that the default button will be "Prev" thus
   losing all the changes.

FIXED: 28/01
- Rendering values does not currently link them to the relevant view 
   page if one exists. New config option? [ yup: browse_link ]
- "bounce" email has DOM reference rather than the actual email!
- the final page of submission should indicate that the first block is
   the "abstract page" and the second block is a dump of all fields.
- OAI fails to flag deleted records as deleted!
