EPrints 2 changelog.

09/01/2002 - EPRINTS-2-ALPHA-2

10/01/2002
 - Added CHANGELOG!
 - Added BUGLIST 
 - Added BUGGLIST & CHANGELOG to the distribution.
 - Session::send_http_header can now send content-types other
    than text/html. Still does text/html by default.
 - added Session::make_indent( $n ) which makes DOM of a CR +
    $n spaces (for laying out OAI XML returns)

21/01/2002
 - fixed bug in get_index_ids - which failed to get the last item from a list
of free words.
 - Added DataObj as a base class for EPrint,Document,User & Subject. Moved
get_value, set_value, get_session,  get_data, get_dataset, is_set, get_id & 
render_value.
 - Removed old OAI code from ArchiveConfig.pm  and some deadwood functions
from OpenArchives.pm
 - OAI now works. cgi/oai and OpenArchives.pm - uses DOM to generate the
replies. Only one function in ArchiveConfig.pm (make_metadata_oai_dc) 
but more metadata formats mean more functions (which is a bit cleaner).
 - Added experimental vlit support so documents can be retrieved as char-
ranges. This is for Ted Nelson research stuff. See www.xanadu.com for more
info. Currently in Xanadu.pm but'll probably get renamed.
 - removed Deletion.pm once and for all.
 - added use_private_cache and cache_id to SearchExpression cache_id can
set the current cache to save searching. use_private_cache: caches and
does not dispose of the cache after but flags it as unusable by other
searches.
 - added a method to session: render data element which returns an indented
XML element containing some text eg. (4,"key","value") ...
    <key>value</key>
 - fixed bug in search expression ( it didn't do the cache checking in the
right place).
 - fixed bug in the ordervalues table which only showed when the archive had
more than one supported language.
[C] - added make_metadata_oai_dc
[C] - XML config files for citation, ruler and phrases now use namespaces 
so that EPrints tags can be prefixed with "ep:" but XHTML tags remain the 
same. Which should make them clearer.
[C] - Added oai_metadata_functions to ArchiveConfig.pm 
[C] - renamed oai_metadata_formats to oai_metadata_namespaces
[C] - added "enable_vlit_support" config option, so you can disable it!
[C] - Added new options to browse views: noindex, nohtml, include, plain, 
citation
[C] - changed citations to contain SPAN class="citation" rather than do 
it in code. and to contain <ep:a> </ep:a> to show where to put the link.
[C] - added oai_sets config option, same format as browse views. 

23/01/2002
 - generate_apacheconf now (optionally) includes directives to pass .txt and
.uni files through the VLit (Xanadu) handler.
 - added VLit and Latex to startup.pl to force mod_perl to load them at the
start.
 - added support for render_value and render_single_value to MetaField.pm
 - removed some broken and useless old browse views linking code from 
MetaField.pm
 - added 3 new executable paths to the CVS SystemSettings: latex, dvips and
convert, convert is invoked as convert_crop_white as we may wish to invoke it
with other options. The autoinstaller does NOT add these new values.
 - put ' quotes around values in default system settings invocations - should
added to installer too.
 - Utils::tree_to_utf8 now understands to turn an <img> into the contents of
the alt attribute.
 - renamed Xanadu.pm to VLit.pm
 - added Latex.pm which calls latex, dvips & convert to turn a latex string
into a PNG and also a method which renders a string as DOM but replaces
bits which look like latex with <img>s which point to cgi/latex2png 
 - added cgi/latex2png which uses Latex.pm to create an image from a latex 
string and serve it. (uses a cache dir so each one only has to be done once)

25/01/2002

 - corrected the namespace in the XML files for XHTML1.
 - removed DOM.pm - going back to using normal one, not our hacked
one.
 - added a get_archive() method to DataSet.pm
 - MetaField: TYPE_SQL and TYPE_INDEX constants are removed and the
results generated directly from the subs which used them. This allows
different values for each archive (eg. for VARCHAR sizes)
 - MetaField: PROPERTIES is now just a list of properties. A value of
-1 means there is no default.
 - get_property_default returns what PROPERTIES used to contain. Allows
archive specific field property defaults.
 - the input field renderer routines now use the properties:
input_rows input_cols input_name_cols input_id_cols input_add_boxes
input_boxes input_style (and digits) to decide size and height and stuff
 - removed HTMLRenderer
 - booleans now can render as menus, radio buttons OR a checkbox 
 - plain text fields can have textareas as their input field.
 - phrase files now have namespaces for ep:foo like other XML files with
XHTML in.
[C] - [this has been undone again! 30/01/2002] added varchar_size option 
to set how big the SQL fields are.
[C] - added FIELD PROPERTY DEFAULTS SECTION WITH the fields:
input_rows input_cols input_name_cols input_id_cols input_add_boxes
input_boxes digits
[C] - fixed BUG in default field validator - now handles multiple
URL fields.
[C] - displaylines renamed to input_rows


26/01/2002

 - added default_action to the render_input_form method and code to
support it.
 - added button order and default_action to all render_input_form calls
where appropriate.
 - fixed braino in new metafield properites handling. All metafields need
a handle on the archive object, so those without a dataset must now have
an archive set. Added archive values to all calls to MetaField->new
 - added a client() method to Session which returns a code for the client,
currently: GECKO, LYNX, MSIE4, MSIE5, MSIE6 and "?". Used this to test
for lynx in the default action handler and not print the image button if 
it is lynx (as lynx ALWAYS displays it, we want it hidden).

28/01/2002

 - new metafield property: browse_link - which is the id of the browse view
it should link to when rendering.
 - added "generic" citations handling, via DataObj render_description which
replaces User::full_name and EPrints::short_title and Document::render_desc
 - added new param to template title field: textonly="yes" to squash down
the XHTML in the <title> into text only.
 - moved render_citation and render_citation_link from Document, EPrint and
User into DataObj. 
 - added get_url to Document, EPrint and User - (renamed the functions
static_url and url)
 - buildpage now takes a title as DOM not UTF8 (so markup is preserved) -
all calls have been changed.
 - fixed a bug in the user mailer. Sent the DOM ref, not the text
 - fixed a typo in edit_eprint which caused a 500 error
 - added a get_type() method to  Document, EPrint and User, returns the
type (as in which citation to use).
 - removed start_html end_html and end_form from Session.
[C] - split user_render and eprint_render into user_render, eprint_render,
user_render_full, and eprint_render_full. eprint_render_full now looks alot
better and puts the abstract page in a slightly darker box. - best to lose 
old render section and require the new one.
[C] - removed ArchiveConfig.pm : eprint_render_short_title and the sub which
returned a user name or "User 44489" - now down with citations.
[C] - added "generic" citations to citations file: these have no type and
are used to render a short (one-line) description.
user_display_name. Now these are done as generic citations for those objects.
[C] - added  textonly="yes" to the titlehere element in the <title> in the
template.
[C] - changed the ID of the public security setting from "public" to "" 
this WILL cause some problems upgrading but
UPDATE document SET security='' WHERE security='public';
will fix it. It means in the document citations we can do ifset on "security".
[C] - added document citations to the citations file - with advice on how
to view PDF and PS.

 - removed Subject::get_name and render and replaced with render_description
(well the one inherrited from DataObj)
 - fixed a bug in edit_subject : was rendering list of eprints in buffer, not
archive.
[C] - added a subject default citation to citations list.

 - upped OAI pagesize to 100 records (from 10)
 - OAI now correctly flags deleted records.
 - OAI now includes values from the deleted eprints when generating sets.
 - cgi/status now uses the phrase file. 
 - added code to Utils::send_mail and User::mail to allow a reply-to
header, other than the eprints admin.
 - fixed bug in search results page which said next 10 records, even if there
were only 7 left.
 - bounce & delete records from buffer now sets the reply-to field of the
email as the editor who did it.
 - fixed a couple of typos from where I added  _order to button lists.
 - added "quotes" around the names in the Utils::send_mail routine to stop
problems with names containing commas.

29/01/2002
[C] - !!!! split parts of ArchiveConfig.pm into
ArchiveOAIConfig.pm
ArchiveRenderConfig.pm
ArchiveValidateConfig.pm
ArchiveTextIndexingConfig.pm
ArchiveMetadataFieldConfig.pm
 and "require" them all from ArchiveConfig.pm. The resulting effect is exactly
the same. EXCEPT. {oai_foo} conf items are all renamed to {oai}->{foo}
[C] - TO upgrade alpha-2 to use OAI! just remove all oai conf items and 
methods from ArchiveConfig.pm, copy ArchiveOAIConfig.pm into the archives 
/cfg/ dir, and then add to ArchiveConfig.pm:
require "cfg/ArchiveOAIConfig.pm";
$c->{oai} = get_oai_conf();
- Latex.pm now uses MD5 to generate cache filename (so it does not go over
256 char limit)

30/01/2002
[C] - !removed varchar_size again!
[C] - changed the default title from a "text" to a "longtext"
 - removed varchar size setting support - the max size is 255. You want more
use a longtext metafield.
 - improved export_xml so it now does ID and NAME parts correctly. And now does
any dataset.
 - Fixed a bug in generate_static which didn't remove the <title> from around
the title name of an xpage.
 
 - the 404 error page now works (although does not spot urls which may have 
expired, yet).
 - can no longer view dir. index in the CGI directories
 - added a <mail> element which is only used to make tree_to_utf8 word wrap 
emails with no <p> elements: it works like a <p> except that \n\r etc are
not turned into generic whitespace.
 - cache settings on cgi pages are now just:
Cache-Control: must-revalidate
  which seems to be what they should have been all along.
 - added a get_status method to session which returns the HTTP status (usually
200!)
 - Subject->children now sorts by Subject name (not id!)
 - cleaned up the error401 page
 - split the document upload page into 2 parts: files and metadata. Cleaned
 up the phrases in that section.
 - the upload a file page now has a seperate form for the cancel button , so 
 that it does not upload the file if you hit "cancel"
[C] - added validate_document_meta to ArchiveValidateConfig.pm - this checks
just the meta data of a document. 

31/01/2002 
 - fixed bug when you have more than 3 items in a list. The form renderer was
chopping off the rest!
 - added a new doc-type: coverimage, which renders as an image on the abstract
page. It's not a required format, though.
 - renamed <ep:a> to <ep:linkhere> because it was clashing with XHTML's <a> 
and DOM lv 1 does not support namespaces.
 - added reindex method to dataset which re-commits EVERY item. Which will 
recreate index and ordervalue tables.
 - added bin/reindex  which is just a handle on that function.
 - added get_noise to session.pm to give the current noise level in command
line tools.
 - made dataset::map actually do a map rather than do it the stupid way. 
Changed the syntax to be the same as searchexp::map and changed things which 
call it.
 - fixed some bits in Document.pm which still thought public docs were 
"public" not "".
 - fixed something in searchexp::perform which assumed we had an order set
when we might not.
 - order values now correctly sort year and int (int not tested yet!)

01/02/2002
 [C] - ArchiveRenderConfig::id_value now returns XHTML-DOM not UTF-8
 - Fixed "clone" bug.
 - Fixed bug which escaped % when it didn't have to.
 - Fixed bug in ArchiveOAIConfig.pm - didn't know what the perl dir was
for making the Identify response.
 - rewrote the DC renderer to be neater.
 - made --verbose in scripts repeatable. 2 gives the SQL, 3 gives the whole
DBI trace.
 - fixed get_value_label to always return DOM. Fixed things that call it.
 - added Database::prep_like_value which escapes SQL value including "%"
 - if for some reason an attempt is made to cache "NONE" from a search it
 now just returns an empty cache.
 - SQL errors now go to the log not the webpage.
 - fixed 'wget' invocation
 - Added Utils::clone which clones a (non recursive) data structure. There
may be a perlmod which already does this, but what the hell.
 - turned MetaField::display_option into render_option
 - GET forms now do not set multi-part which reduces the annoyance of 
hitting the back button.
[C] - moved system variable phrases into system file from archive file.

02/02/2002
 - now removes un-needed ordervalue rows.
[C] - added username and userid to user search fields.
[C] - added document types: other and cover image to citations file.
 - fixed typo "=" instead of "=>" in edit user. And a utf8 which should
have been DOM.
 - remove_user feature now works, and so does the cgi script which calls
it.
 - added in some missing fieldnames in the phrase file for system fields.
 - fixed the title of the user search page.
 - changed staff user edit to have a different blurb.
 - added oneshot_cache to staff searches (user & eprint) so that
ordering works.
 - undefined phrases now get mentioned in the log.
 - fixed typo in MetaField EPrint:: should have been EPrints::

04/02/2002
 - passwords are now encrypted as they come from the form not as they go
into the DB! subtle but important change. They are also crypted when they
come from bin/create_user. Web based signup always crypts now.
 - icky SQL in cgi/confirm to swap around values from newpassword/newemail to
password/email. 
 - added an "unspecified" option to sets and subjects which are not multiple
or required so you can unselect them again if needed.
 - web based searches now use the cache again.
[C] - moved the eprints to unqualified DC code in OAIConfig to its own
function so that it can also be used to make metadata on abstract pages.
[C] - render_eprint can now optionally return a 3rd values, a list of 
links and metadata which it uses the DC maker in OAIConfig to make DC.foo
meta fields in the page header.
[C] - the suggestions field now renders in its own box to make it clear what
it is.
[C] - input_rows on the month field set to 1 so it becomes a pull-down.
[C] - ruler.xml now uses the entities.dtd file, not that it'll ever matter!
- added "-" to escaped values in LIKE params.
- moved "next" on search page to the right end of the list so it does
not get as confusing when you goto page 2.

05/02/2002
[C] - trimed out "dc" from OAIConfig.pm again, probably not going to
have time to add it before v2.0
[C] - OAI: Added "format" items to unqualified DC which give format &
URL of that doc.
[C] - cleaned up static pages to be "nice" for version 2.0 - added in
"powered by" images for things like apache & XHTML.
- import_eprints now needs to know which dataset - so you can export from
one and import into another.
- fixed bugs in export_xml multilang bit.
- top level tag of exported xml is now <eprintsdata> and does NOT have 
a dataset id.
- new Session method: render_link which creates an anchor: <a href="foo">
it also uri_escapes the href. All places which did do make_element("a",...
now use this instead.
- ImportXML now also needs to know which dataset to import to.
- everywhere theres a 'chdir' it now chdir's back to the origional dir
again.
- cleanded up subjects "depositable" field - now uses nice radio buttons.
- removed uses of the word "paper(s)" to keep the text more generic.
- cleaned up 2 errors in the CSS
- renamed setlang to set_lang and internationalised it.

[c] - removed "nowrapper" opt from views conf: now does no <p> wrapper round
citations if using custom citation.
- VLit stuff now uses charrange rather than byterange and requires "xuversion"
to be set.

06/02/2002
[c] - tweaked the OAI renderer to handle bad months!
[c] - commended out the "lang" field in metadata-types: {users} as it's
only needed for multilingual archives.
- VLit now runs over all of the "document" area but not secure docs or the 
front page.
- VLit now returns 401 or 501 where appropriate.
[c] - table on the default frontpage is no longer 100%: looked bad in IE.
- SearchField definitions now use 3 values rather than the icky
PHR:EQ:fred format. Still serialise OK. Also ANY/ALL/PHR is not needed if 
match mode is not "IN" and if match mode is not specified it defaults to
"EQ" - which is usually used internally.

[c]- fixed typo in citations file.
- fixed bug in "area" code of VLit
- removed sub render_struct - use Data::Dumper, dammit.

07/02/2002
[c] - removed defaults for "os" and "security" as these are no longer
meaningful. Defaults are now ""
[c] - changed template to use <pin> rather than <pagehere>, <titlehere> etc.
- Language now logs which lang a missing phrase was in (not in!)
- added change_email feature to user area.
- $user->mail() can now send email to a different address to the one given
(for email change).
- VLit now has an xml-entity mode
- added "latest" cgi script which lists the last weeks additions.

- CGI param mainonly now supresses the template and just serves the body.

11/02/2002
[c] - Rewrote warn and error thresholds to be 1024*foo to make a easier to work
out in megs. makes no functional difference.
[c] - cleaned up the refereed field and removed the Latex stuff from the default
configuration.
[c] - validation routines now check names have a family & a given part.
[c] - removed some unused citations.
[c] - commented out editorsubjects - not needed until we start using them.
- stopped mentioning editorsubjects on the "buffer" page, until they are used.
- now uses 'df' properly to decide which dir to use. Also cleaned up error log
message and emails caused by low disk space.
- DataSet totally ignored system fields required setting now a field is 
required if it is required in the system field conf function OR the metadata-
types.xml file.
- mainonly param was causing a warning, now checks it's defined first.
- buffer page items are now sorted by datestamp (newest first)
- made a note in the h2ph warning that you should be root when running it.

12/02/2002
[c] - Changed vlit config options. Now you can configure where the URL goes.
- added "context" mode to vlit which highlights around the quote. 
- vlit human mode now uses CSS.
