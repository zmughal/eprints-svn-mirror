EPRINTS 3.0.3 (RC1)                                            2007-08-28
=========================================================================

 * Added Latidude+Longitude to the example data. 
 * Fixed bug with URLs in text (not HTML) emails.
 * You can now test STAFF_ONLY is false in workflows.
 * .txt files should now be indexed.
 * Fixed the bug with the subject-search in input forms.
 * You can now put a <title> inside a <field> in workflow. This will 
    override the normal title for that field. And you can put the 
    contents in a "if" or "choose".
 * generate_views now caches the subjects, speeding up the generation
    of subject field views quite a bit.
 * New options to help EPrints work with single sign-on systems:
   * New configuration option, on_logout. This option is a function 
      pointer. The sub is passed ( $session ) and is called when the 
      /cgi/logout page is viewed. Handy for removing cookies.
   * New configuration option: get_login_url. Function. If this exists, 
      it is called when a secure page is requested and no user is 
      authenticated it takes ( $session, $url ) as parameters. $url is 
      the URL of the page the user wants to view. It returns the URL of 
      a page to redirect them to log in (ideally this page will end up 
      sending them back to $url when they have logged in.
   * New configuration option: get_current_user. Passed ( $session ).
      If this function exists it should return the user object of the
      user currently logged in. This can be obtained from a cookie or
      something more clever. 
 * Fixed an issue with memory leaks when importing XML using XML::DOM.
