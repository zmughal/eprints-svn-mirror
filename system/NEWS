-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mostly a bugfix release. Does not change any functionality. (except the 
staff EPrint search)

*       Fixed lots of typos and minor bugs.

*       Changed the default subjects config file to Library of Congress

*       Staff EPrint search can now search all buffers: archive, inbox, 
        buffer and deletion.

*       edit_eprint can now edit eprints in any buffer, and move eprints 
        between buffer, and clone any eprint into the submission buffer.

*       view_submission & edit_submission are now deprecated. All their 
        functions have been taken over by edit_eprint.

*       Added a oai2 script which is experimental and more-or-less speaks
        OAI-PMH v2.0a3

First official release.

*        Too many changes to mention.

This is the origional release of eprints 2. It did not actually do 
anything very useful, it just let people see how the project was
progressing.
