OAI

 * Extra sets in OAI: By ID field, or by configurable serialised search. 
    Even "subject" should be configured. so "subject:blgy:biophys" 
    or "username_id:cjg" or "stuffjackwants" which is a search of 
    it's own. Searches can of course be modified with from and to 
    dates from OAI.


Database

 * Turn docid into an int (no minor feat) [longterm]
 * check Database.pm for any sql without escaping. and 
    SearchExpression.pm and SearchField.pm 


Search

 * Make nice ordering for titles so "the" does not affect order
      + similar in other fields? names?
 * Add congiguration via cookie for n results, citation style &
    default search.
 - Don't index words in inbox/buffer? [maybe/maybe not]
 * Add search-by-id
 * Fix email searches
 - reconsider max time for caches eg. 30 for latest?
 - Phrase searching
 - Improved steming.
 - Add a get_problems method to searchexp which returns a list
    of problems. This should run by default when verifying "search"
    type fields?
 - Create buffer uses VARCHAR for a key, not.. er... INT where possible.
   eg. for subject and document


Command Line Tools
 
 * generate_views needs to say what order stuff is in. [kinda hard, it
     uses a custom order]
 * Clean up export XML command. [XML headers etc.]
 * For generate_views, subscriptions, abstracts etc. Maybe have an
          archiveid of ALL which runs the script once for each archive?
      + or allow more than one.
 . Make tools run as "eprints" if they are running as "root". 
    -Forces "Taint" checking which certain eprints bits just can't darn
       handle.

  in input forms.
 
 . Commentary summary page (Psycoloquy style)
