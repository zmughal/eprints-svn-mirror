# This function allows you to override the default username/password
# authentication. For example, you could apply different authentication rules to 
# different types of user.
#
# Example: LDAP Authentication (Quick Start)
#
# Tip: use the test script to determine your LDAP parameters first!
# Tip: remove the set-password priviledge from users and editors in
# user_roles.pl. Also consider removing edit-own-record and 
# change-email.

#
#	# Distinguished name for this user
#	# The distinguished name is a unique name for an LDAP entry.
#	# e.g. "cn=John Smith, ou=staff, dc=eprints, dc=org"
#	# You will need to derive this from the username or user metadata
#	my $ldap_dn = "cn=$username, ou=yourorg, dc=yourdomain";

# Advanced LDAP Configuration
#
# 1. It is also possible to define additional user types, each with a different
# authentication mechanism. For example, you could keep the default user, 
# editor and admin types and add ldapuser, ldapeditor and ldapadmin types with
# LDAP authentication - this would suit an arrangement where internal staff are 
# authenticated against the LDAP server but user accounts can still be granted 
# to external users.
#
# 2. Sometimes the distinguished name of the user is not computable from the 
# username. You may need to use values from the user metadata (e.g. name_given,
# name_family):
#
#	my $name = $user->get_value( "name" );
#	my $ldap_dn = $name->{family} . ", " . $name->{given} .", ou=yourorg, dc=yourdomain";
#
# or perform an LDAP lookup to determine it (more complicated):
#
#	my $base = "ou=yourorg, dc=yourdomain";
#	my $result = $ldap->search (
#		base    => "$base",
#		scope   => "sub",
#		filter  => "cn=$username",
#		attrs   =>  ['DN'],
#		sizelimit=>1
#	);
#
#	my $entr = $result->pop_entry;
#	unless( defined $entr )
#	{
#		return 0;
#	}
#	my $ldap_dn = $entr->dn
#
# Alternatively, you could store the distinguished name as part of the user 
# metadata when the user account is imported
