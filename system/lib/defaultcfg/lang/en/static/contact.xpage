<!-- **************************************************

This page, by default, only has the email address of 
the site administrator ( taken from the primary XML
file in opt/eprints3/archives/ ) 

We suggest adding other contact information such as
subject-editors, user-support and policy makers 
emails, etc, as appropriate.

It's handy having all the contact details on one 
and only one page - it means that when they change
you didn't forget to update them somewhere else.
