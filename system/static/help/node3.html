Certain accounts need you to register with the system so that it can identify you. Principly, the subscription (alerting) service and document depositing services require registration. When you register with the system, you will be given a username and password that you will need to access those areas of the archive.

<P>
The registrations page (accessible using the navigation bar on the left of each screen, or from the site front page) contains instructions for registering, how to tell us you've changed your e-mail address, and how to be reminded of your username and password if you've forgotten them.
