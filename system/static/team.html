<HR />

<P>The CogPrints project would not have been possible without the efforts of these previous members of the team:</P>

<h3>Software Developer</h3>
<p>Matt Hemus did his undergraduate and postgraduate work at the <a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/">University of Southampton</a> in Electronic Engineering. His primary research interests are electronic document representation, electronic communication, hypertext and interactive Internet applications. He was senior programmer on the Cognitive Sciences E-Print Archive project between 1 August 1996 and September 1998, and responsible for the design and implementation of the original CogPrints archive.</p>

<h3>Archive Administrator</h3>

<p>Vanessa Oliver was the initial CogPrints Project Administrator. She worked closely with Matt Hemus, the programmer, and Stevan Harnad, the director, in setting up the project. She ran the CogPrints office, trained the Archive helpers, and provided the start-up telephone and e-mail helpline. Vanessa studied counselling and psychotherapy part-time while working on the CogPrints project and will shortly become a qualified Psychodynamic therapist.</p>
