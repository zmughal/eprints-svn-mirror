Submission:
- Reduce number of pages for submission
- Reduce back button problem with forms
- Use style sheets/javascript to preload
- Add new components base on page selections
- Determine whether a user is an author or depositor based on previous activity
- Present a list of co-authors from previous papers (or other project sources)
- Include the depositor's name / preferred form of name by default
- Automate ordering of others?
- Suggest several options of name presentation
- Re-euse conference publishers/titles
- Conferences/journals could complete with appropriate previous conference names
- Provide a persistently available overview of the process
- Use plain language (avoid 'add another format', use 'upload your deposit')
- Examine conference web sites for data?
- Ready uploading of endnote or bibtex lists of data
- Associate files to bibtex entries 
- Integrated submission: Have a save as pdf + submit to EPrints option. Takes
  directly to EPrints entry screen to confirm some fields + ask for more info.
- Use LaTeX/Word metadata for autocompletion
- Provide LaTeX/Word templates that can be parsed easily (for when templates
  aren't provided by conferences, etc).
- 'Watch folders' - upload documents dragged into a folder
- Auto-generate tech report numbers?
- Automatic change from in press -> published at a certain date

More community-based things:
- Encourage conferences/journals to publish conference info in an EPrints-friendly
  format. Provide toolsto help.

Editing:
- Select an eprint, choose 'edit' to show a single page with editable fields, press
  submit to save changes, then confirm completion/movement to archive.

Version control:
- "clone" is confusing. Better to have "new version" on existing eprint. Can show
  edit form.
- Tech reports could be associated with papers as a 'longer discussion'
- Allow depositor to determine how versions will be presented/counted by EPrints.
  e.g. 'this version should be available, but all drafts + final should be in one
  other doc'.

User Stats:
- See total number of peer-reviewed journal papers this year/since last RAE
- Number of conference papers
- Papers associated with a project 

Export:
- Make it easy to include archive data in web pages
- Provide well-CSSed output to allow for styling.
- Suggestion: Choose how to represent work (date/type/project, etc), then output
  has divs in correct places.
- Provide instructions re how to include the parts.
- Provide easy-to-share links representing groups of publications. Make it simple
  to add parameters to these searches.

Other:
- Multiple servers: Allow a project to include files from multiple EPrint databases
- Show citation info on pages

Specific bits

Search:
- Show /where/ the search matched (e.g. the author, the references, etc) - provide
  ordering based on these? Allow ordering based on dates
- Headers in search lists (Authored By, Referenced To, Mentioned In)
- Easy addition of sort options (e.g. date alone, by author + date, etc)
- Saved searches: order by date/title/project/etc
- Keep search history to allow for future saving. 
- Allow to see all searches with marked searches highlighted
- Allow non-registered users to save queries
- Searching sometimes returns unlikely results (e.g. keyword not present in any of the
  fields that it claims it's searching)

Search results:
- Allow customisable results per page
- Searchers want info on abstracts, author links, publication place, etc, in search results
- Visual cues (?)
- Add additional info per article result or for all - as fast as possible. (sounds like
  iTunes when you right-click on a heading bar and add a new heading)
- Support special characters for article names in maths, names, etc
- Export results to bibtex, endnote, etc
- Thumbnails of web pages

Browsing:
- Consult with groups to identify appropriate subjects. LCSH?
- 'Apparent unification' - even if >1 archive per subject, show them as one browse
- Browse by author.
- Browse by 'kind' (e.g. demonstration, lecture, recording, etc)

Latest:
- Organise 'latest' by school/group, subject, kind, with 'time' as optional. 
- Highlight for today, this week, this month, etc
