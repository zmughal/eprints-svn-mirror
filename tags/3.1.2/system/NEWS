EPRINTS 3.1.2
=========================================================================

Admin Tools
 * "Edit phrases" tool appears in toolbar for admins, on pages that are
    generated "on the fly". It allows web-based editing of the phrases
    used to generate the page, including missing phrases.
 * Improvements to web based phrase editor.
 * "Edit page" option now appears if a static page is viewed by an
    admin, making it easy to get to the right edit screen.

Views
 * In views, links to empty pages are now rendered as text, not links.
 * /view/ pages may now be exported in the same way as searches.

Search
 * search.pl is now split into one file per search.
 * Search forms now have a show_help option to allow the help to be
    always hidden or always shown. The default is the toggle button.

Submission
 * Can now use <upload-methods> option in upload component 
    configuration, in a workflow, to set which methods are available 
    to upload files (or set to an empty list to stop new documents being 
    created). Zip, from url etc.
 * Document fields can now be marked as required, and will have the star
    appear and report problems if not set. 
 * Now when you add a document or modify one, it's always unrolled when 
    the page upload form is rendered.

Import & Export
 * RSS2 now has thumbnail and media data, this allows some new fun 
    mash-up.
 * New Excel and CSV import and export plugins.

Saved Search and Review emails
 * Improved style of HTML format emails.
 * Fixed broken links in emails.

Other
 * .xpage files can now have a <template> to override the use of the 
    default template.

    CHANGELOG for details.

    Audio, Dataset, Experiment, Teaching Resource.

    etc.

 * Fixed bug which left many cache tables lying around.
 * Tool to edit the subject tree

    be set to unspecified.
 * Plugins may now have an "advertise" flag. If this is false then the
    plugin is not advertised in the user interface but is still 
    available.
 * Plugins may now be disabled by default. This is used if you have 
    several repositories and only want to enable the plugin on one.
 * XML Export now makes the XML nicely indented.
 * The workflow may now conditionally limit the options available for a 
    set. This allows, for example, to make certain options only available
    on some types of EPrint or only to certain users.

    of the subject tree are available for different eprints or users.
 * New default fields for projects and funders and organisational

    benefit of search engines.
