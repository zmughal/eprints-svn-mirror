=head1 NAME

EPrints::Test::ProcessSize - track the increase in Apache process size

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# Add to cfg/apache.conf
	PerlInitHandler EPrints::Test::ProcessSize

Then monitor the Perl apache error log.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module hooks into the PerlInit and PerlCleanup stages of mod_perl to test whether the Apache child process has increased its footprint (based on GTop's 'resident' memory).

The log entries look like this:

	[pid] before increase method uri

Where:

=over 4

=item [pid]

The child process id.

=item before

The resident size before running the request.

=item increase

The increase in memory size after running the request.

=item method

The HTTP method (GET/POST etc.).

=item uri

The URI that was requested.
