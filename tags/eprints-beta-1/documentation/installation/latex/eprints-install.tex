\section{Introduction}

This document explains how to set up and install an \eprints\ archive on a UNIX system. The instructions should allow users to install the archive on any UNIX implementation, such as Solaris, SGI IRIX or Linux. In addition to generic instructions, specific instructions are also given on how to install the system on a Redhat 6.\emph{x} Linux system, the recommended platform on which to run the \eprints\ software.

Although this document is rather large, much of it is to do with configuring various aspects of the system. If you are happy with the default metadata sets and site look and feel, you won't have to work through all of it.


\subsection{Beta Release Note}

Many of the procedures in this installation document might change for the main release. If and when you install a production server, you should obtain the relevant installation document for that version.

It is hoped that in later versions, much of the installation process will be automated, reducing the effort involved in this process greatly.
