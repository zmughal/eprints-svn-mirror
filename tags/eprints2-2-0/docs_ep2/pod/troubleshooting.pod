=head1 Trouble Shooting 

This section covers some things which can go wrong and why. If you have a suggestion for this section, let us know!

It will grow as people suggest new problems and solutions. Check the http://www.eprints.org/ website for the latest version.

=head2 System gives a "500 Internal Error" when viewing advanced search or submitting a document

Possible cause: No Subjects

Solution: Run B<generate_subjects>

=head2 Apache Crashes with a segmentation fault.

Possible cause: apache linked against "expat" library. If you did not install apache from source then it is possible it was linked against the "expat" library. The problem arrises that it is also linked against mod_perl and when we use the XML::Parser module, that is also linked against expat. 2 expat's in one apache make it seg-fault.

Solution: Build apache following the detailed instructions in the "requried software" section of the documentation.

=head2 Changes to the config didn't appear on the website

Possible cause: Several.

Solution: Rebuild everything by re-running (for the archive in question) B<generate_static>, B<generate_views>, B<generate_apacheconf> then stop and start apache. B<generate_abstracts> can take a long time, so don't run it unless you want to update the abstracts themselves.
