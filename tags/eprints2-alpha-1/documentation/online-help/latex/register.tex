\section{Registering}

Certain services require you to register with the system so that it can identify you, such as the subscription (alerting) and document depositing services. When you register with the system, you will be given a username and password that you will need in order to access those areas of the archive.

The registration information page (accessible using the navigation bar on the left of each screen, or from the site front page) contains instructions for registering, how to tell us you've changed your e-mail address, and how to be reminded of your username and password if you've forgotten them.
