Encode-LaTeX version 0.1
========================

This module provides encoding to LaTeX escapes from utf8 using mapping tables
in L<Pod::LaTeX> and L<HTML::Entities>. This covers only a subset of the
Unicode character table (undef warnings will occur for non-mapped chars).

Mileage will vary when decoding (converting LaTeX to utf8), as LaTeX is in
essence a programming language, and this module does not implement LaTeX.
