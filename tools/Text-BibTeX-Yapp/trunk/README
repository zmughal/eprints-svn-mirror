Text-BibTeX-Yapp version 1.00
=============================

This module provides a pure-perl BibTeX parser, based on a Parse::Yapp grammar
(you don't require Parse::Yapp though).

If you want a complete BibTeX solution you probably want to look at
Text::BibTeX.

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test

REBUILDING FROM THE GRAMMAR
