IRStats Metadata Input Files

The IRStats import_metadata command imports metadata for use in the irstats environment. This is separate to the usage data import.

There are 6 input data files:

irstats_set_member_codes.txt, irstats_set_member_full_citations.txt, irstats_set_membership.txt, irstats_set_member_short_citations.txt, irstats_set_member_urls.txt and irstats_set_phrases.txt.

All files are tab-separated format with one record per line (line returns must be removed). Lines starting hash (#) or blank are ignored.


set_member_codes

<set> <internal id> <external id>

Where:
 set - the set type
 internal id - a unique positive integer for the set
 external id - a unique identifier for the set

Description:

Codes define a 'set'. Every eprint is a single set. Other sets may contain lists of eprints (defined in set_membership) e.g. eprints by an author. It's strongly recommended that you restrict set type names to [a-z_].

Example:

eprint	1032	1032
subjects	52	DAW


set_membership

<set> <internal id> <eprint id list>

Where:
 set - the set type
 internal id - the internal id of the set
 eprint id list - list of eprint internal ids in the set

Description:

Memberships allow eprints to be aggregated for the purposes of generating statistics. An eprint id list is a list of internal eprint ids (i.e. positive integers) separated by spaces. Every eprint must at least be a member of its own eprint set.

Example:

eprint	1032	1032
subjects	52	1032 5032 5033


set_member_{full_citations,short_citations,urls}

<set> <internal id> <value>

Where:
 set - the set type
 internal id - the internal id of the set
 value - the citation/url to render for this set (HTML)

Description:

These three files provide human-readable text to be rendered when viewing the given set in lists or on the dashboard. Each set should have at least a short_citation (typically the external code or identifier).

Example (short_citation):

eprint	1032	Light-induced metallization at the gallium-silica interface
subjects	1032	LOC-DAW


set_phrases

<phrase id> <phrase>

Where:
 phrase id - the phrase identifier
 phrase - the phrase (HTML)

Description:

Phrases are human-readable terms used in the irstats system. You should at least define a phrase for each set type - where the phrase id is the set type name prepended with 'set_'.

Example:

set_eprint	Eprint
set_subjects	Subjects
view:TopTenTable:title	Top Ten Eprints by Downloads
