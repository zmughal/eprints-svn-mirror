IRStats
-------

IRStats is a Web log analysis tool aimed at Institutional Repositories.

Features:

 - Process logs from Eprints versions 2 and 3
 - Process logs from DSpace (work in progress)
 - Multiple robots filtering techniques
 - Analyse usage of eprints or sets of eprints
 - Analyse logs by author, subject etc.
 - Many different graphing outputs


Requirements:

 - awstats
 - Geo::IP perl library
 - Date::Calc perl library
 - Logfile::EPrints perl library
 - ChartDirector (www.advsofteng.com) *
 
 * Commercial products.

Installation
------------

Install the following modules from CPAN:

 Geo::IP - required for Organisation database (PurePerl won't work)
 Date::Calc
 Logfile::EPrints

 $ cpan
 > install Geo::IP
 > install Date::Calc
 > install Logfile::EPrints

CPAN may require configuring and/or install further dependencies.

Unpack the IRStats tarball to a convenient location (e.g. /tmp).

 $ tar xzf irstats-*.tar.gz

Configure irstats.cgi to reflect your local pathing

The following lines need to be changed.
Line 1: 
	#!/usr/bin/perl -w -I/opt/eprints/perl_lib
Line 11:
	use lib "/opt/eprints/perl_lib/ChartDirector";

Change the paths to those of your perl and eprints installs (e.g. on debian systems eprints may be contained in the /usr/share directory)

Line 8:
	use lib "/usr/local/awstats/wwwroot/cgi-bin/lib";

This library path also needs to be change to that of your awstats lib directory (on linux - 'locate awstats | grep lib' will help)

Installing IRStats into EPrints Path
------------------------------------
Copy the contents of the perl_lib directory into the  eprints3/perl_lib directory

Copy the contents of the cgi directory into the eprints3/cgi directory

Copy local_cfg/irstats.cfg to each repository's cfg directory

Copy the local_cfg/static/irstats directory and contents into each repository's cfg/static directory

Initilising IRStats
-------------------
As eprints, run (for each repository)

  $ eprints3/cgi/irstats.cgi <repositoryid> setup
  $ eprints3/cgi/irstats.cgi <repositoryid> update_metadata (cron this to run nightly)
  $ eprints3/cgi/irstats.cgi <repositoryid> update_table (cron this to run nightly too)

DONE
----

Also available in local_cfg/cfg/cfg.d is an example eprint_render.pl script which includes 2 download graphs (Monthly and Daily) on each eprint abstract page. Simply copy this over your eprint_render.pl in archive_name/cfg/cfg.d to make use of this.

The interface will be available at <repositoryurl>/cgi/irstats.cgi
