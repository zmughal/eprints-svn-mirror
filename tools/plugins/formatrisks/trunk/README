Pre-Requisits

    * EPrints 3.2 or greater! You need the new File object which is a core part of >=3.2. 

    * The EPrints 3.2 Preservation Tools
          o Consists of a bunch of files to be installed in the following locations under the archive_name directory
          o These can be copied over in the following way
	          o cd archive_name
          	  o cp -r cfg /usr/share/eprints3/archives/myarchive/
          o Finally make a tools directory in your eprints root and drop tools/update_pronom_puids in it.

    * A copy of java 

    * A copy of DROID from (http://droid.sf.net), we recommend version 3.0 or 4.0 with the latest signature file (version 36 at time of writing). Dropping this in the tools directory created earlier is probably a good idea. 

    * The following perl modules
          o XML::Parser::PerlSAX 
          o SOAP::Lite 

Installing

1) Install java and DROID

2) edit archive_name/cfg/cfg.d/pronom.pl and fill in the locations to your DROID install, DROID signature file, DROID execution command, and JAVA. Changing other config values is optional but recommended to suit your repository and risk score boundaries.

3) Install the new database structure.

 bin/epadmin update_database_structure 

Running

To run simply execute the update_pronom_puids tool, this should be scheduled to run regularly.

 cd tools
 perl update_pronom_puids archive_name

Alternatively there is a classify objects button available in the web interface which can be installed by copying the optional screen plugin from the optionals directory.
