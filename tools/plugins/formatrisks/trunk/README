Pre-Requisits
=============

    * EPrints 3.2 or greater! You need the new File object which is a core part of >=3.2. 

    * The EPrints 3.2 Preservation Tools
          o Consists of a bunch of files to be installed in the following locations under the archive_name directory
          o These can be copied over in the following way
	          o cd archive_name
          	  o cp -r cfg /usr/share/eprints3/archives/myarchive/
          	  o cp -r bin /usr/share/eprints3/archives/myarchive/

    * A copy of java 

    * A copy of DROID from (http://droid.sf.net), we recommend version 3.0 or 4.0 with the latest signature file (version 36 at time of writing). Dropping this in the tools directory created earlier is probably a good idea. 

    * The following perl modules
          o XML::Parser::PerlSAX 
          o SOAP::Lite 
          o Async 

Installing
==========

1) Install java and DROID

2) edit archive_name/cfg/cfg.d/pronom.pl and fill in the locations to your DROID install, DROID signature file, DROID execution command, and JAVA. Changing other config values is optional but recommended to suit your repository and risk score boundaries.

3) Install the new database structure.

 bin/epadmin update_database_structure 

Running
=======

To run simply execute the update_pronom_puids tool, this should be scheduled to run regularly.

 cd myarchive/bin
 perl update_pronom_puids archive_name

Doing the Exercises
===================

In order to do the exercises the following three configuration values need to be set in archive_name/cfg/cfg.d/pronom.pl.
These already exist however need to be set up as follows for the exercises to make sense. 

$c->{"enable_preservation_actions"} = 1;

$c->{"allow_droid_classification_control"} = 1;

$c->{"pronom_unstable"} = 0;
