1) Create a folder which represents your repository
2) Copy .config_example to this folder and change each of the parameters outlined
3) run watch_folder.pl with the parameter being the absolute path to this folder.
4) To create a new resource, create a new folder in the repository folder you have created and start dropping documents in it, these will then get uploaded to the repository. 

WHAT WORKS
==========
* Uploading of first document and initial creating of resource in repository.
* Adding additional documents to the resource
* Updating documents (you save locally, changes are reflected in the repository)
* Updating documents (a change happends to the same document URI in the repository, the change will update locally)
* Deleting documents (both local and remote)

WHAT DOESN'T (YET)
==================
* Downloading of new documents only known to the repository.
* Downloading of resources already in repository to repository folder. 

CAVEATS
=======
* Authenticated HEAD requests don't work on EPrints.
* Atom exporter on EPrints requires updating to make the thing which don't work... work.
