* added oai_write_eprint_metadata stub to SiteRoutines

cfg/subjects. Warns user that this is dangerous and requires them to

Thu Feb  8 10:50:23 GMT 2001
* Added # comments to config files Language.pm MetaField.pm MetaInfo.pm 
Subject.pm

Mon Feb 19 22:03:36 GMT 2001
* Removed multiurl type - will become url: multiple=yes
* Changed Username from TEXT to VARCHAR(255)
* Changed create table code to make Aux tables for multiple fields!
* update() and add_record() now take an array ref for data rather than an array of arrays. Still don't handle aux tables yet. Updated all code using these methods.
* removed: 
  get_user_fields 
  get_document_fields 
  get_subject_fields 
  get_subscription_fields 
  get_deletion_fields 
  get_all_eprint_fields 
 and replaced them with get_fields( $table ) which allows for some neater
coding and to identify fields by table in update() and add_record(). Updated
all code using these methods.
