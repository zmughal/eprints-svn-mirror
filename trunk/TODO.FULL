TODOSOON:
	rewrite SearchField code.

Bugs:
  * Daily subscriptions still in buffer bug
  * jbug#64 doubled up prefixs

code:
* db:
	* make most , including url, allow multiples
	* make add_record and update understand multi's
	* make everything else understand them...
	* make index length configurable
	* hunt down all instances of format_name and Name::extract
	

* MULTITEXT is a silly name for a field maybe LARGETEXT? 

* FINISHED button is confusing on deposit files pages!

* Change views to a sub dir...
  + Multi page for really long ones?
* userid field sepearate to username
   + only if conf option is set.
   + conv functions both ways.
   + only required in modifying and searching DB
   + Change USERNAME of person subbing paper to type username(single)
* userid/username split.
    + username becomes userid
	- make it validate on user info too
	- add a 'strict' option
    + userid/name combo field 
	- make it editable, searchable etc.
    + OAI: People as a set!?
    + TEXT/ID field for everything else.
* views
    + make views output which dosn't use wrapper.
    + make people views too, configurable.
* add some <BR> to end of left menu
# make rebuild sets work nicer?
* new user type "Local"?
* "filter" concept for staff.
* "private" formats
* EPrints.pm - can you succeed someone elses item if you're staff?
* configuration for "filter" and "userid" fields?
* trawler, processor to convert eg latex to ps?
* cgi/user page is a little iffy. Make it look nicer?
* add bin/site for user created bins?
* add user.types (extra info for local or staff!)
* scaling - better indexes and temp tables?
* search on INT (greater & lower?)
* session->{request} is it used?
* Internationalisation!
	+ finish lang file!
	+ SiteInfo issues
	* check all s/r's values don't contain $()!!! no loops!
	* use $(name) rather than $(1)
	+ SiteRoutine issues
	+ User lang? for mail!
	+ cfg files
	+ metafields
	+ field HELP
	+ static pages?
	+ subject files
	+ months!
	+ What about .htaccess?
* do CFG files get seperated accross instances?
* CGI Scripts - some should be NO CACHE.
