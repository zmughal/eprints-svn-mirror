=head1 EPrints Archive Configuration

This section describes all the configuration files in an single archive in the EPrints system.

=head2 Primary archive configuration file

Once you have created an EPrints archive the information you entered is placed
in an XML file in /opt/eprint2/archives/ with the name I<archiveid>.xml - this
file is documented later in this section.

=head2 Archive configuration directory

The bulk of the archive configuration is copied from /opt/eprints2/defaultcfg/ into the archives own configuration directory (usually /opt/eprints2/archives/I<archiveid>/cfg/ This directory will usually contain the following files and directories:

=over 8

=item B<apache.conf>

This file is generated by B<generate_apacheconf>. See the documentation of B<generate_apacheconf> for more information.

=item B<ArchiveConfig.pm>

The general configuration items which don't fit anywhere else are in this perl module. It is described fully later in this section of documentation. This module "requires" the other 5 perl modules. They are in seperate files to make them easier to get to grips with. 

=item B<ArchiveMetadataFieldsConfig.pm>

This module configures the metadata fields and the default values.

=item B<ArchiveOAIConfig.pm>

This module configures how the archive exports itself via the Open Archives protocol.

=item B<ArchiveRenderConfig.pm>

This module contains subroutines which handle rendering the data into XHTML (mostly) for display as webpages.

=item B<ArchiveTextIndexingConfig.pm>

This module handles turning UTF8 text strings into lists of index words for free text searches.

=item B<ArchiveValidateConfig.pm>

This module contains subroutines which check the metadata for problems.

=item B<auto-apache.conf>

This file is generated and overwritten by B<generate_apacheconf>. Do not edit it directly.  See the documentation of B<generate_apacheconf> for more information.
=item B<citations-I<languageid>.xml>

One of these files for each I<languageid> supported by this archive.
These XML files describe how to turn metadata for an item into a citation (with markup). They are described fully later in this section of documentation.

=item B<entities-I<languageid>.dtd>

One of these files for each I<languageid> supported by this archive. These DTD files are generated automaticly by B<generate_dtd> and should not be edited directly.

=item B<metadata-types.xml>

This XML file describes the various types of eprints, users etc. and which metadata fields are required or relevant to each. It is described fully later in this section of documentation.

=item B<phrases-I<languageid>.xml>

One of these files for each I<languageid> supported by this archive. These XML
files contain all the phrases which are specific to this archives such as the titles of metadata fields.  They are described fully later in this section of documentation.

=item B<ruler.xml>

This XML file just contains the horizontal divider used in webpages created by the system. It is described fully later in this section of documentation.

=item B<static/>

This directory contains the data needed to create the static webpages such as the homepage, and about page. It is described fully later in this section of documentation.

=item B<subjects>

This file contains the initial subjects for the system. It is described fully in the documentation for B<import_subjects>.

=item B<template-I<languageid>.xml>

One of these files for each I<languageid> supported by this archive. These XML/XHTML files describe the outline for webpages for this system.  They are described fully later in this section of documentation.

=head1 XML Config Files in EPrints

This section contains some general information about the XML archive config files: template, phrases, ruler and citations. metadata-types.xml uses XML but these comments do not apply. 

=head2 XHTML

This files use HTML elements (and other elements too). XHTML is a fairly new version of HTML which is back compatable with HTML 4 but written using XML not SGML. This means that it is much stricter but less ambiguous and easier to parse and modify. Assuming you know HTML, the main differences are as follows:

=over 8

=item Tags must be closed

All elements must be closed, even ones such as E<lt>liE<gt>. Tags which do not have a close tag in HTML, like E<lt>brE<gt> or E<lt>img src="foo"E<gt> still must be closed eg. E<lt>img src="foo"E<gt>E<lt>/imgE<gt> - this can be abbreviated to the more neat looking:  E<lt>img src="foo" /E<gt>

=item All tags and attributes must be lower case

Self explanitary.

=item Strict definition of what tags may appear within which others.

Not actually checked by EPrints. It will let any rubbish past as long as it's valid XML. But that's no reason to be naughty. 

=item All attributes must be wrapped in quotes

In HTML the values of attributes do not have to be wrapped in quotes, but in XML (and therefore XHTML) they do.

=item All attributes must have a value 

In HTML some attribues did not require a value, for example in E<lt>hr noshadeE<gt> elements. In XHTML it is represented as  E<lt>hr noshade="noshade"E<gt>.

=back

So in summary, the HTML:

 <img SRC=someurl>
 <hr NOSHADE WIDTH=2>
 <P>Foo bar</P>

should become in XHTML:

 <img src="someurl" />
 <hr noshade="noshade" width="2" />
 <p>Foo bar</p>

And that's more or less it. See w3c.org for a complete description.

=head2 Language specific files.

phrases, template and citations have one instance per supported language. This allows the system to generate pages and emails in more than one language. Supporting a new language will require translating the all the english in the english config files currently shipped. If you do intend it do this (lots of work!) please get in touch with the eprints admin so that we can avoid duplicated effort.

=head2 Extra Entities

The XML files all use a DTD which defines a few extra entities. Entities are items in XML (or HTML) which start with "&" and end with ";" like &amp;. These additional entities come from the entities DTD file created by generate_entities. One DTD is created per language, although currently the only variation is the archive name.

=over 8

=item I<&archivename;>

The name of the archive in the current language.

=item I<&adminemail;>

The administrators email address.

=item I<&base_url;>

The base URL of the system (without a trailing slash)

=item I<&perl_url;>

The base URL of the CGI directory (without a trailing slash)

=item I<&frontpage;>

The URL of the system homepage.

=item I<&userhome;>

The URL of the user homepage.

=item I<&version;>

The current EPrints version.

=item I<&ruler;>

The XHTML of the standard divider.

=back

These entities are not available in the citations file.

=head2 Name Spaces and XHTML

These files contain a mixture of custom tags and XHTML. To keep these distinct the XML files contain a name space definition in the first element. The pratical upshot is that all EPrints own tags have the prefix "ep:". The namespace information is actually ignored by the current version of the eprints system.

example of mixed tags (and entities):

 <ep:phrase ref="lib/session:contact"><p>Feel free to contact 
 <a href="mailto:&adminemail;">&archivename; administration</a> 
 with details.</p></ep:phrase>

 eprints elements: phrase
 xhtml elements: p, a
 eprints entities: archiveemail, archivename

=head1 Primary archive configuration file

This XML file appears in the archives/ directory, usually /opt/eprints2/archives/, it describes the most very basic details about the archive. It is generated (and modified) by configure_archive and will not normally need to be edited.

EPrints looks in this directory for XML files and attempts to load them all
when starting the webserver.

This file should be chmod'd so that it can not be read by random users as it contains the database password.

The top level element is "archive" which has the attribute "id" which is the id of the archive. It should be the same as the filename. If this file is foo.xml then the id should be foo.

E<lt>archiveE<gt> contains a list of XML tags enclosing some text. eg.
  
  <host>stoatprints.org</host>

The following tags are expected in no special order:

=over 8

=item host

The hostname of this archive.

=item alias

This is optional and may be repeated. It has the attribute "redirect" which may be set to yes or no. This controls what virtual hosts are supported and if they  should redirect to the main (E<lt>hostE<gt>) one.

=item language 

The ISO id of a language supported by this archive. Repeatable. One of these should also be the defaultlanguage. See below.

=item port

The port number that the server is running on. Usually 80.

=item urlpath

The directory from the root of the server name. Usually /

=item archiveroot

The filesystem path of the rest of the archive configuration.

=item configmodule

The path to the perl module which does the main configuration (ArchiveConfig.pm)

=item dbname

The name of the MySQL database. Usually the same as the archive ID.

=item dbhost

The host on which MySQL is running. Usually localhost.

=item dbport 

An optional MySQL port, if it's not the standard one. Should be empty if we are to use the default.

=item dbsock

An optional MySQL socket. Should be empty if we are to use the default.

=item dbuser

The username to use when connecting to MySQL, usually "eprints".

=item dbpass

The password to use to connect to MySQL.

=item defaultlanguage

One of the supported language. This is the default for this archive.

=item adminemail

The email address of the archive administrator. I strongly suggest that this is an alias rather than a personal email address. If all your webpages contain "bob@footle.edu" and bill takes over from bob you would have to regenerate every page with "bill@footle.edu". Much better to set up an email alias or forward from "archive-support@footle.edu" and point it at bob (for now). Heed these words spoken from grim experience!

=item archivename

The name of the archive. This has an attribute "language" the value of which is an iso language id. There should be one of these archivename elements per supported language. eg.

    <archivename language="en">White Lemur</archivename>
    <archivename language="fr">la archive d'Lemur Blanc</archivename>

(apologies to the french, human languages aren't my strong suit)

=back

=head1 ArchiveConfig.pm

This module imports the other 5 perl modules. It allows lots of little tweaks to the system, which are all commented in the file.

It includes options to hide various features you may not want and to customise
the browse and search functions.

Customise what each type of user can and can't do, and how they authenticate their passwords.

Also methods which are called when a session starts and ends, to log things, to generate the entities for the entities file and security on non public files.

=head2 Browse Views

The browse views are generated by the script "generate_views" and what that
script does is configured by the "browse_views" item in the config.

It is a reference to a perl array [], each item of which is a hash {}.

The hash has 3 required properties and a number of optional ones.

=over 8

=item id [required]

The ID of this view - the view will be placed in a subdirectory of /views/ of this name. The ID is also used to identify the full name of this view in the phrase file. id=>"foo" would find it's title in the phrase "viewname_eprint_foo"

=item fields [required]

The list of the names of the fields to browse, seperated by a slash "/". This should normally be a single field unless you want to merge the values of two fields. The id part of a field may be specified by appending ".id" to the fieldname.

=item order [required]

A list of fields to sort by in order of priority, sepearted by slashes "/". A minus sign prefixing the fieldname "-" indicates reverse sorting on that field.

=item allow_null

Should we make a page for the "unset" condition? A page for items which do not have a year set may be useful. But for other fields this may be meaningless. Set it to 1 for true.

=item include

Generate a file for every value, ending in ".include" which contains the XHTML of the citations of records and the number of records, but without wrapping the site standard template around it.

=item nohtml

Normally the system generates a page like that described for "include" with a .html suffix and the site template. If nohtml is set to 1 then it won't. 

=item citation

Normally the citation used is that for the "type" of eprint. If this is set
then that citation (from the citations file) will be used for all items. This
allows for some clever stuff if you want to make page which can get sucked into another website. 

Normally the system puts a paragraph tag around each citation, but if you use a custom citation this will not happen.

=item nocount

Do not include the count of how many items at the top of the page.

=item nolink

The system generates an index.html in /view/ with a list of all the browse views available. Setting nolink to 1 will hide this item.

=item noindex

Do not generate an index.html file in /view/I<foo>/ listing all the values of the view and linking to their respective pages.

=back

The most common view is to browse by subject:

 { id=>"subject", allow_null=>0, fields=>"subjects", order=>"title/authors" }

A more complex view generates a view on author & editor ID's which are not advertised but may be captured by some other software to build staff CV pages.
 
 { id=>"person", allow_null=>0, fields=>"authors.id/editors.id", nohtml=>1,
   nolink=>1, noindex=>1, include=>1, order=>"-year/title" }

For my example person id "wh" this will generate a webpage called /view/person/wh.include (and one for each other value of authors or editors ID's) which can be captured by an external automated system.

=head2 User Privs

The user permission configuration allows you to set what types of user can and can't do. The user home page will only show a user options which they can do.

New types of user, and which data about themselves they can edit is set in metadata-fields.xml.

Permissions are set by "type" of user. By default there are 3 kinds of user:
"user", "editor" and "admin". 

Admin can, by default, do everything.

=over 8

=item subscription

Does not do anything. Subscriptions are planned for a later release.

=item set-password

Reset their password via the web registration system.

=item deposit

Submit items into the archive.

=item view-status

View the archive status page.

=item editor

User can edit then approve submitted items into the main archive, or delete them, or return them to sender. Also can remove items from the archive back into the edit buffer for corrections, and move records into the deleted table [delete them].

=item staff-view

User can perform a "staff search" of user or eprint records and view ALL the metadata.

=item edit-subject

User can edit the subject tree via the online interface.

=item edit-user

User can edit other users records.

=item change-email

User can change their email address via the web interface. This is safer than allowing them to edit it directly as it ensures they cannot set it to an address which they recieve (it mails them a confirmation pin number)

=item change-user

This allows the sinister feature which lets you log in as someone else. It still requires a password. This is useful if you want to perform admin tasks as a super user, then log-in as a normal user to deposit items.
