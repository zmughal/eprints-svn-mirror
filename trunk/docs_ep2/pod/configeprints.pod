=head1 EPrints General Configuration

This section describes all the configuration files in the EPrints system which do not relate to any specific archive.

=head2 EPrints Configuration Directory

The general EPrints configuration directory is usually /opt/eprints2/cfg/ and contains the following files:

=over 8

=item B<apache.conf>

This file is generated by B<generate_apacheconf>. See the documentation of B<generate_apacheconf> for more information.

=item B<auto-apache.conf>

This file is generated and overwritten by B<generate_apacheconf>. Do not edit it directly.  See the documentation of B<generate_apacheconf> for more information.

=item B<auto-apache-includes.conf>

This file is generated and overwritten by B<generate_apacheconf>. Do not edit it directly.  See the documentation of B<generate_apacheconf> for more information.

=item B<languages.xml>

This XML file contains an (exhaustive) list of all ISO language ID's and their names.

=item B<system-phrases-I<languageid>.xml>

One of these files per language needed for any archive in this system. These files contain the phrases needed to render the website and email in each language, not counting names of things like metadata fields which vary between archives. It should not be edited by hand, but may be overridden. See the instructions on phrase files in the archive config documentation.

=item B<SystemSettings.pm> 

Described below.

=back

=head2 SystemSettings.pm

This is a perl module which is created and edited by the eprints installer script when installing or upgrading EPrints. It's found in C<perl-lib/EPrints/>

SystemSettings contains system specific things:

=over 8

=item B<base_path>

The root directory of your eprints install. Normally /opt/eprints2/

=item B<executables>

A hash of the path of various external commands such as sendmail and wget.

=item B<invocation>

A hash of how eprints is to invoke various external commands. The variables with uppercase names - $(FOO) - are replaced with parameters from eprints, the lowercase names - $(sendmail) - are replaced with the strings in executables.

=item B<archive_formats>

An array of id's of archive formats offered in the upload document page. For each their must be an entry in the archive_extension and invocation, $(DIR) is the where eprints wants the contents of the archive and $(ARC) is the archive file.

=item B<version_id >

The id of the current eprints version.

=item B<version >

The human readable version number.

=item B<user >

The UNIX user eprints will run as. Usually "eprints".

=item B<group >

The UNIX user eprints will run as. Usually "eprints".

=item B<virtualhost> (Since v2.1)

If this is set, it is used for the VirtualHostName in the Apache configuration files. (By default EPrints uses "*").

=item B<disable_df> (Since v2.1)

If this is set to 1 then this disables the parts of EPrints which use the df call (disk free). If the "configure" script tested the "df" command and found that it failed the this function will initially be set to 1, otherwise 0.

=item B<enable_gdome> (Since v2.2)

If this is set to 1 then it enables the use of the XML::GDOME module, rather than XML::DOM. XML::GDOME is faster and less memory intensive but depends on a number of other libraries and modules which are not worth installing for a trial system.
