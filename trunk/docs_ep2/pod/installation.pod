=head1 Installation

unpack the eprints tar.gz file, and run the install-eprints.pl script, answer the questions it asks.

edit your apache.conf in the way described by install-eprints.pl.


=head1 Creating an archive

Make sure MySQL is actually running.

Change to  your eprints user (probably "eprints").

cd to the eprints directory (/opt/eprints2 by default) and run bin/configure_archive, answer the questions it asks.

Run

 bin/generate_dtd archiveid
 bin/create_tables archiveid
 bin/generate_static archiveid
 bin/create_user archiveid userid email admin password

Where userid, email and password are your choice. you can create multiple users if you like. 'user' instead of 'staff' will give a user less privs.

Then restart your webserver: 

 /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd stop
 /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd start

Don't just use 'reload' or 'restart' as these do not force mod_perl to reload it's modules.

Now connect via the web and see if it works...

The submission form does not actually work fully yet, if you want some initial data to play with, get the harris.xml file from the Eprints "tools" directory ( http://www.eprints.org/files/tools/ ) and run:

 import_eprints archiveid harris.xml

Which will spew tons of debug info, but should actually put some (fairly ropey) data into the archive.
