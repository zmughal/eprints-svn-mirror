Updating from EPrints 1

This path is not currently supported, as the software structure
underwent fundamental changes. We recommend that you do a clean install of EPrints 2.0.

We hope to provide an v1 to v2 "upgrade assister" at some point.

Updating from EPrints2 alpha-2 to EPrints 2.0

=head2

Too much of the configuration of the archive has changed to document individually. See
the C<CHANGELOG> file if you're really interested. If you have more than one
archive, then do each step for each one. Our example is the archive with the ID I<foobar>.

To upgrade we suggest you use the UNIX C<diff> command to make a records of changes 
you made to the archive config directory.

 diff /opt/eprints2/defaultcfg/ /opt/eprints2/archives/foobar/cfg/

Store the output from diff somewhere safe.

Remove C</opt/eprints2/archives/foobar/cfg/>

Now install eprints 2.0 and agree to upgrade when it asks.

Copy the new default configuration into your archive dir:

 cp -R /opt/eprints2/defaultcfg/ /opt/eprints2/archives/foobar/cfg/

Work through the "diff"  you produced, and re-apply the changes 
to the contents of C</opt/eprints2/archives/foobar/cfg/>.

You also need to execute the following SQL command.

 UPDATE document SET security='' WHERE security='public';

To connect to mysql via the command line run:

 mysql -u eprints foobar -p

And enter the database password for that archive.

Now re-run C<generate_apacheconf> and restart apache.

Upgrading from 2.0 should be less painful than this, the config
files should change less dramatically from now on.
