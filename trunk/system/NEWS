EPRINTS 2.2.0                                                  2002-10-31???
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*       Fixed several minor issues in OAI2 support.

*       Several changes to defaul configuration (eg. default results
        page number of records now 100, not 10).

*       New field for subscriptions: mailempty? which makes mailing
        empty subscriptions optional.

*       Added option to have "subject editors" who may only edit certain
        eprints, ie. all in one subject, or only books & posters.

*       Added editor alerts to mail editors, similar to subscriptions.
 
*       Added a hook for doing something "clever" with certain 404's. This
        is useful if you are migrating from a different system, eg. eprints 
        v1 and want the old links to be forwarded to relevant new locations.

*       New metadata parameters
             - can_clone
             - sql_index
             - id_editors_only 
             - allow_set_order 
        See the relevant documentation for more information.

*       Added support for XML::GDOME which is a faster XML module, but does
        require some more software. This is strongly recommended for non-demo
        systems as it's faster and uses less memory.

*       Improvemnts to generate_views including
              - optional timestamps (when they were generated)
              - option to hide subjects with no eprints in yet

*       Automatic hash checksum logging. Every time a document file is 
        changed, a MD5 hash value is stored. See the documentation for why
        this is useful. A command "rehash" will generate and log hashes for
        all documents (handy to do initially). The command line tool 
        export_hashes will create a hash of each hash file for logging away
        safely.

*       Searches may now have default values.

*       Improved layout and information of "status" page. Now mentions last
        time subscriptions were mailed.

*       New command line tool which causes archives to reload their 
        configuration without restarting apache. This is NOT very efficient 
        and will waste memory, but is handy for development.

*       ### Nearly Done ### citations now use @year@ instead of &year; to 
        make XML parsing easier. Also there is a new feature <ep:ifmatch>  
        which gives access to the eprints search syntax to make citation 
        elements conditional. Also improvements have been made to the citation 
        rendering code so that elements may now be safely nested. (eg. <ep:isset>.

*       No GIFs (Due to patent issues, and EPrints being part of GNU),
        PNGs used instead.

*       Improved configurability of subscription mails layout.

*       Improved configurability of search result pages layout.
 
*       There is now a "Submit Later" button on the deposit page.

*       Added experimental support for the secure part of the site to
        be served via https.




EPRINTS 2.1.1                                                  2002-07-04
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed a bug in the OAI 2.0 support. Otherwise identical to EPrints 2.1.


EPRINTS 2.1                                                    2002-07-04
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release contains a major new feature - subscriptions. It also has
OAI-PMH v2.0 support and a few new configuration options.

*       Various bug-fixes, typo-fixes and clarification of text.

*       Added subscriptions - which allows a user to configure searches to
        be run periodically and any new results mailed to them.

*       Now OAI 2 compliant. Note OAI-PMH v2 base URL is different to OAI
        v1 URL - /perl/oai2 - /perl/oai will continue to work.

*       New options in SystemSettings.pm 

        - disable_df which is set disables all the places eprints uses "df". 
          (It is buggy on some platforms).

        - virtualhost which is the value to use in the apache config files
          in VirtualHost entries. By default "*" is used, but some people need
          to change it.

*       Added "POD" documentation to about half of the main perl modules. The
        other modules have stubs describing the methods, but no actual 
        documentation. Use "perldoc Foo.pm" to view docs of a file.

*       Added a new type of metafield - "search". Which is a serialised 
        search expression. Not very useful for normal metadata - the primary
        use is for subscriptions.

*       You can now use XHTML entities in the phrase files, static pages
        and the page template eg. &nbsp; &pound; &eacute; etc. These are
        not available in the citations config file.

*       New built-in "custom" field render method: 
        EPrints::Utils::render_xhtml_field which can be set as a 
        render_single_value option in a metafield, it will pass through
        all XHTML elements rather than &lt;foo&gt; escaping them which the
        normal renderer does.

*       New optional configuration options:

        - "pagehooks" to allow extra "stuff" to be added in the <body> and 
          <head> parts and attributes to the <body> tag. This allows people 
          to do clever stuff, like add javascript to some pages.

        - "submission_stages" which allows the admin to change the order
          of the submission form.

        - "submission_hide_howmanyfiles"
          "submission_hide_upload_archive"
          "submission_hide_upload_graburl"
          "submission_hide_upload_plain" - these allow an admin to supress
          parts of the eprints file upload page.

*       New metafield attributes: 

        - export_as_xml: This defaults to 1 but if explicitly set to zero it 
          will supress this field in output from export_xml.

        - make_value_orderkey: this is a reference to a function which will
          generate a value to compare alphabetically to order this field.

        - make_single_value_orderkey: as above but only gets passed individual
          values even if the field is multiple.
        
        - fieldnames: used by search fields to configure which fields can be
          searched.  

*       New script - upgrade. This updates the SQL database of an archive to
        work with the latest version of eprints.

*       generate_views should now correctly sort values in the index paeg.

*       Order by subjects, sets or datatypes should now be alphabetical.
       



eprints-2.0.1                                                  2002-04-16
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mostly a bugfix release. Does not change any functionality. (except the 
staff EPrint search)

*       Fixed lots of typos and minor bugs.

*       Changed the default subjects config file to Library of Congress

*       Staff EPrint search can now search all buffers: archive, inbox, 
        buffer and deletion.

*       edit_eprint can now edit eprints in any buffer, and move eprints 
        between buffer, and clone any eprint into the submission buffer.

*       view_submission & edit_submission are now deprecated. All their 
        functions have been taken over by edit_eprint.

*       Added a oai2 script which is experimental and more-or-less speaks
        OAI-PMH v2.0a3

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

First official release.

*        Too many changes to mention.


eprints-2-alpha-2                                              2002-01-09
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the origional release of eprints 2. It did not actually do 
anything very useful, it just let people see how the project was
progressing.
