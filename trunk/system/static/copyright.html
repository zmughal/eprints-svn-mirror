<blockquote><i>"What about the copyright issues associated with CogPrints?
e.g. If I</i>
<br><i>want to publish a paper in a "normal" journal: do I have to ask
the</i>
<br><i>journal's editor for permission to submit the paper (non-refereed
and</i>
<br><i>refereed) to CogPrints?"</i></blockquote>
CogPrints is an author's archive; as such, it has the same relation to
an author's work as the author's home institution does, when that work
is archived on the home server (as all CogPrints authors are strongly advised
to do, in addition to archiving it in CogPrints).
<p>It is accordingly the author who must adopt a policy about copyright.
We can only offer some generic advice:
<ol>A distinction should be made between the unrefereed preprint and the
refereed, edited, published reprint. No copyright agreement has any bearing
on the unrefereed preprint, which can be publicly archived online before
the refereeing even takes place.
<p>Hence the rest of the points below pertain only to the refereed, edited,
published reprint. Preprints can be archived without reference to any copyright
agreement or publisher.
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>Note, however, that a minority of journals have indicated that they
will not referee papers that have been publicly archived online. It is
not clear whether any attempt has been made to enforce such a policy --
or indeed whether it would be possible to enforce it at all -- as so many
authors are archiving their papers publicly on their home servers. See:

If you have not signed a copyright transfer statement that cedes your right
to publicly archive your own paper online for free, it is not clear that
there is any problem, but if you wish to confirm this, you should inform
your publisher that you wish to do so, and request confirmation that there
is no legal obstacle. Some journals (such as all those published by the
American Physical Society) <a href="ftp://aps.org/pub/jrnls/copy_trnsfr.asc">explicitly
permit </a>public online archiving of the final published draft by the
author; others attempt to <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/misc/con-info.shtml#conditions">specifically
forbid</a> it in their copyright agreements.
<p>Note that any copyright agreement pertains only to the final, refereed,
edited draft that appeared or will appear in print. It does not, and cannot,
cover pre-refereeing preprints or indeed any penultimate draft that preceded
the final one. (The nature and size of the requisite difference between
the two is to all intents and purposes arbitrary.) Nor does it cover substantive
post-publication revised drafts, nor (most important) post-publication
lists of "corrigenda" to the pre-publication preprint. This suggests a
simple, legal way of getting around even the most restrictive copyright
transfer agreement, as long as the author has already publicly archived
the pre-refereeing preprint:

<p>If you have signed a copyright transfer agreement ceding your right
to publicly archive your own paper online for free, you should contact
your publisher indicating that you wish to do so; matters are evolving
rapidly in this area and publishers may well be coming around to more justifiable
and enforceable policies.
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
You should always try not to sign restrictive copyright agreements. They
are completely unjustified, they have nothing to do with protecting the
author's intellectual property (for the refereed journal literature, which
is and always has been an author <i>give-away</i>), they are only there
to protect the publisher's revenue streams, and energetic steps are being
taken to put an end to them as soon as possible. See the current copyright
discussions and proposals in Science, Nature, American Scientist, and Chronicle
of Higher Education, respectively:</li>

a more detailed discussion about the copyright issues involved follows.

<br><a NAME="policy"></a>
<blockquote><i>"Can I ask a journal to change their copyright policy?</i></blockquote>
Stefano Ghirlanda of Stockholms Universitet offers the following advice:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>If you would like to ask a journal to modify their copyright
policy so that you and others can post your articles on the web, you might
find the following suggestions helpful.</blockquote>

<dl>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Take the initiative</b></dt>

<p><br>Many journals will accept a copyright agreement different from their
standard one if asked to, but will not offer a liberal agreement from the
beginning.
<p>Thus, when you get the copyright-transfer form from a journal, just
send back a different, already signed one with a science-friendly policy.
You can model your requests after the American Physical Society's (APS)
policy, which can be found at:
<p><a href="ftp://aps.org/pub/jrnls/copy_trnsfr.asc">ftp://aps.org/pub/jrnls/copy_trnsfr.asc</a>
<p>A possible sample text is:
<br>&nbsp;
<dl><i>I hereby transfer to [publisher or journal] all rights to sell or
lease the text (on-paper and on-line) of [paper-title]. I retain only the
right to distribute it for free for scholarly/scientific or educational
purposes, in particular, the right to self-archive it publicly online on
the Web.</i></dl>

<p><br>More precise wording (legally speaking) can be found in the APS
policy above. It should be made clear that only noncommercial distribution
will be unrestricted, and that the publisher will retain all commercial
rights.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt>
<b>In case of a "no"</b></dt>

<p><br>If your agreement is declined by the journal, it may be helpful
to express concern that an unjustifiably restrictive copyright policy hinders
the free circulation of research findings. Point out that researchers'
future willingness to submit to a particular journal could be influenced
by its copyright policies.
<p>Some journals are owned by Learned Societies, but the copyright is often
managed by a commercial publisher. Try to go through the Society first,
especially if you are or have been a member.
<p>You can consider your time well spent even if the publisher fails to
accept your conditions. It is important that the journals know what researchers
are recognizing to be important preconditions for submission in the on-line
era.

<blockquote>&nbsp;
<br><i>"Any further advice?"</i></blockquote>
First I will tell you the correct answers, and then I will describe the
potential complications, and how they are likely to be sorted out.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><i>"Will inclusion of a paper in CogPrints count as 'publication'
and hence render the paper no longer publishable in paper journals?</i></blockquote>
You must specify for/to <u>whom</u> it will "count"!
<p>An Eprints Archive is certainly neither a journal nor a publisher; it
is an on-line archive for providing free access to research, pre- and post-refereeing/publication.
All authors retain the copyright for any papers they deposit and any unrefereed
preprint that they archive in an Eprints Archive, they will&nbsp; also
(we hope), in parallel, go on to submit to a refereed journal, as they
always did.
<p>Appearing in an Eprints Archive is merely like appearing in a University
Department's Tech Report Series (more and more of which are now electronically
available too). For unrefereed preprints, CogPrints is just a global, collective
Tech Report Archive for the Cognitive Sciences (but now globally integrable,
through the Open Archives Initiative, into what is effectively a world-wide,
pan-disciplinary, "virtual archive," free for one and all).
<p>After that paper is refereed, revised and accepted by the peer-reviewed
journal to which is has been submitted, the question arises about what
to do with the archived <u>pre</u>print then: (1) Leave it in the archive,
(2) withdraw it, or (3) supersede it with the final refereed, accepted
<u>post</u>print?
<p>I assume that authors would overwhelmingly prefer (3), whereas journal
publishers may well prefer it otherwise. Indeed, they may prefer it otherwise
even for the preprint, not just for the published reprint... I will return
to this.
<p>The natural thing to do, and certainly the optimal thing for authors
(if they overcome the restrictions of their journal publishers) when their
article is accepted in this electronic age is to make the validated, peer-reviewed
version as widely available as possible to everyone for free. There is
no reason why its potential research impact should be constrained by fee-based
access-barriers.
<p>In the paper days we mailed reprints (for free); in the electronic age
the natural thing to do is to email eprints. And there is no longer any
need to go through the tedious reprint-requesting and reprint-sending phases;
the eprint can simply be made universally available on the Net, either
in the author's home institution's Eprint Archive (as part of the University's
Electronic Reprint Series) or in a centralized, discipline-based Eprint
Archive such as CogPrints (or both: Open Archive interoperability makes
both solutions equivalent).
<blockquote><i>"Who retains copyright of the material? does inclusion in
CogPrints imply implicit relinquishing of copyright by the author?"</i></blockquote>
The author retains the copyright. Nothing is relinquished, and authors
will be expected to submit their papers to refereed journals in the usual
way.
<p>Where copyright issues <u>will</u> come up is on the question of whether
authors should continue assigning full copyright to the publishers of the
refereed journals, thereby in effect authorizing the publisher to restrict
access to their papers (and hence restrict their potential research impact)
only to those who pay to see them.
<p>This is a <u>huge</u> conflict of interest, and it will be in this arena
that the critical events will occur, not in the question of assigning copyright
to electronic Archives: Unlike publishers, neither CogPrints nor University
Eprints Archives has any financial interest in blocking access to the papers
it archives, whether pre- or post-refereeing. Indeed, CogPrints has no
financial interests at all, and Universities' interest, like the authors',
is maximizing the potential impact of their research (the financial rewards
come from the recognition and funding that <u>results</u> from the research's
achieving its maximum impact)! The Eprint Archives are extremely cheap
to maintain, and as their enormous potential contribution to learned inquiry
and research impact is demonstrated, they will continue to be a part of
Universities' infrastructure, just as the Web itself is.
<p>I will come back to this when I discuss the APA's (American Psychological
Association's) provisional policy on these issues.
<blockquote><i>"What kinds of papers would be included? whose papers would
be included?"</i></blockquote>
An Eprints Archive is not, and is not intended to be, a refereed journal.
Archiving of unrefereed preprints will be entirely under the author's control
(although Archives will no doubt do some filtering to flush out the crazies).
So anyone can archive anything, in principle, either in a centralized,
discipline-based Archive such as CogPrints, or in their University's Eprints
Archive. (All will be harvested into global "virtual archives" anyway.)
<p>We have the precedent already of the <a href="http://arxiv.org">Physics
Archive</a>, which has been public for over a decade and is already the
locus classicus for nearly half the research in physics worldwide, and
still growing. There are as many crazies in Physics as in any other discipline,
but they have a negligible effect on the Archive.
<p>Researchers searching the research literature will continue to seek
the work of the authors they know and trust; moreover, there will always
be <u>two</u> categories of papers in Eprints Archives: unrefereed <u>pre</u>prints
and, first, author-authenticated <u>post</u>prints of refereed, accepted
papers (in the first phase it will be the author who "marks" them as such),
and perhaps eventually also official, journal-authenticated postprints.
<p>Now, to return to those questions that concern what existing journal
publishers will do:
<p>First, note that what the physicists have already done is again the
harbinger of what will happen in all disciplines sooner or later. The inevitable
and optimal outcome for researchers in all disciplines is that their refereed
scientific and scholarly journals will abandon the trade model on which
they are produced now. The trade model was unavoidable in the paper era,
no matter how badly it served research and researchers: There was no choice
but to treat refereed research reports (which are and always have been
<u>give-aways</u>
from their researcher/author's standpoint, not sources of sales revenue,
which merely serves to limit their impact) in exactly the same way that
books and magazine articles
<br>(which are not, and never have been give-aways, but potential sources
of royalty or fee revenue) were treated: The publisher charged readers
for access to the "product," because that was the only way to recover the
substantial cost of publishing in paper.
<p>But whereas in trade publishing there is no conflict of interest between
author and publisher -- both wish to receive payment for access to their
product -- in refereed learned journals the author never sought (or received!)
payment for his "product" (the report of his research). He merely went
along, reluctantly, with the only viable economic model there was (namely,
the trade model) if he wished to be published, and hence to have any research
impact, at all.
<p>The American Physical Society, the most prestigious publisher of refereed
journals in physics, is working out with the Physics Archive a cooperative
arrangement in which preprints can be submitted to APS for refereeing through
the Physics Archive.&nbsp; Once they have been accepted for publication
by an APS journal, authors can self-archive their final, refereed draft,
and if readers want to (pay to) see the "official" APS version (PDF), there
is a link to that as well.
<p>This partitions what used to be the classical publishing function into
two separate components:
<br>(1) the <u>essentials</u>, being the unrefereed preprint and the refereed
postprint, which includes the all-important service of implementing peer
review and (2) the <u>optional add-ons</u>, in the form of publisher's
paper version, or the PDF (and whatever further value the publisher may
add therein).
<p>The devil is in the details, of course, because although the APS (like
the APA (American Psychological Association), and the other APS -- the
American Psychological Society) are learned society publishers rather than
trade publishers, they must take steps to ensure that they are not ruined!
<p>I believe those steps will be the following (but note that here I am
trying to predict what the actual path to the inevitable and the optimal
will be, so this is <a href="http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/2-Resolving-the-Anomaly/sld005.htm">hypothetical</a>,
in contrast to the foregoing passages about freeing the refereed literature
through self-archiving, which are not hypothetical):
<p>Currently, the cost of publishing the average refereed article is about
$2000. That is the total amount that the subset of institutions on the
planet who are able and willing to pay the Subscription/Site-License/Pay-Per-View
[S/L/P] costs for access to that article are currently paying.
<p>The proportion of that cost that is dedicated to paying for the <u>implementation</u>
of refereeing (because the peers in fact referee for free) is about 10%
or $200 per (accepted) paper. If the publisher provides only that service
-- let us call it Quality-Control and Certification [QC/C], certified by
the journal's brand-name -- then that $200 per accepted paper can be paid
for by the author-institution out of 10% of its annual 100% savings from
the cancellation of all S/L/P costs. The refereed papers themselves will
be free for everyone, online, in each institution's interoperable Eprint
Archives, and the remaining 90% annual savings can be spent in other ways
(e.g., on books, which are not, and never will be, author give-aways).
<p>Or the 90% or even 100% can continue to be spent on the optional add-ons,
via S/L/P -- but the refereed literature will all be free on-line either
way.
<p>That's what I (and an increasing number of others) think will be the
inevitable and optimal solution. But what do publishers think, now? I append
here, with comments, the APA's provisional policy on this. Let me note
that they are not alone. The New England Journal of Medicine formulated
a similar policy a few years ago, invoking, by way of justification, the
"<a href="http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad00.lancet.htm">Ingelfinger
Rule</a>."
<p>Let me add, though, that the APA, too, is <u>us</u>. It is up to us
whether we comply with this provisional policy for the time being, for
it is certainly a policy that is against our interests -- and one that
could not be implemented if we chose not to comply.
<p>I am not advocating a course of conflict with the APA. I am an advocate
of quiet, sustained subversion rather than aggressive confrontation (for
which there is no need, as the APS story is demonstrating). I think, therefore,
that the best course of action is simply to ignore the following three
"rules" that the APA has provisionally formulated (supposedly on our behalf,
as we are they -- the editors, referees and authors -- and they are us):
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><i>From:</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/posting.html">http://www.apa.org/journals/posting.html</a></i>
<p><i>American Psychological Association:</i>
<p><i>Posting Information on the Internet</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>So you want to put your article on the Internet on your own home
page or</i>
<br><i>that of your university. What's the problem? There can be a few,
especially</i>
<br><i>if you want to later publish the article or if it has already been</i>
<br><i>published.</i>
<p><i>At their Spring 1996 meetings, the APA journal editors and the Publications</i>
<br><i>and Communications (P&amp;C) Board took a long look at the implications
of the</i>
<br><i>Internet for publishing.</i>
<p><i>* Notices in such journals as Neuroscience and the New England Journal
of</i>
<br><i>Medicine alert authors that papers posted on the Internet are</i>
<br><i>considered already "published" and will not be considered for print</i>
<br><i>publication.</i></blockquote>

<p><br>Now <u>who</u> is considering them as published, and will not consider
them for print publication? Is it the readers of the APA journals? the
authors? the referees? the editors?
<p>No, for all four communities I have named are still perfectly capable
of distinguishing unrefereed preprints from refereed articles, whether
the distinction occurs in the on-paper or the on-line medium. The distinction
is medium-independent and we all know exactly what it is.
<p>Now in certain special cases, medical journals may have a real justification
for warning their authors not to circulate unrefereed preprints, whether
in paper or electronic form: Publicizing results that have not yet undergone
peer review could be dangerous to public health.
<p>But that concern is likewise medium-independent. Journals are free to
set policies that are really intended to protect public health. But how
much of the scientific -- or even the biomedical -- literature falls into
that category? Cold fusion, for example, which was an instance of results
that should not have passed peer review (although they did) was set aright
much more quickly and effectively through the open unrefereed discussion
and scrutiny it underwent on the Net!
<p>Never mind: Let us concede that there are <a href="http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Papers/Harnad/harnad00.scinejm.htm">special
areas</a> in which it is justified to refuse publication if authors have
self-publicized unrefereed findings that put public health at risk.
<p>But what is at issue here is that vast preponderance of the research
literature that does <u>not </u>fall in that category (and this includes
the vast majority of the papers that appear in APA journals).
<p>For that literature, the APA edict against archiving unrefereed preprints
on the Net is unjustifiable and completely at odds with the psychological
research community's interests: Would such a rule have been accepted if
it forbade us to circulate our paper preprints [the ones we send around
"for comments only, not for quotation or citation"], as we have been doing
all along?
<p>If the policy would have been seen as clearly unjustified (and unenforceable)
in the paper medium, then exactly the same is true on the Net.
<blockquote><i>* Papers posted on the Internet may be considered in the
"public domain"</i>
<br><i>and downloaded, incorporated into someone else's work and copyrighted</i>
<br><i>by them (i.e., authors can "lose" their own copyrights and their
own</i>
<br><i>right to print publication).</i></blockquote>
I will not dwell on this statement. It is completely false, and by now
I expect that there are many people in the APA who are embarrassed by it.
<p>Statements like this have been made by the big commercial publishers,
in an effort to intimidate their authors about posting their preprints
on the Net. APA should be ashamed for doing likewise.
<p>What underlies the effectiveness of this completely false statement
is a confusion (in the minds of <u>authors</u>) between copyright as protection
from:
<blockquote>(C1) theft of <u>text</u>, which, for the research community,
is simply a victimless crime! every reprint-requester I send my paper to
is not only "stealing" my text -- by not paying for it -- but I am actually
paying [the offprint and postage costs] to aid and abet him in his crime!
In short, this kind of theft is <u>not</u> what the nontrade author wants
copyright protection from;</blockquote>
versus copyright as protection from:
<blockquote>(C2) theft of <u>authorship</u>, in which someone else publishes
my work as his own. This IS something that authors very much want to be
protected from (perhaps worrying more about it than is really necessary,
but let's skip over that), but this is not at all what is at issue in archiving
one's preprints on the Net!</blockquote>
The scare-tactic is to imply that posting on the Net is a threat to C2
(which authors certainly do not want) but in reality it is to prevent C1,
which authors <u>do</u> want!
<p>Nontrade authors must start to <a href="http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/2-Resolving-the-Anomaly/sld006.htm">think
more clearly about copyright</a>.
<blockquote><i>* Posting a published paper on the Internet may violate
the copyright transfer agreement related to the print publication.</i></blockquote>
It may indeed. And hence authors are well-advised not to sign such copyright
transfer agreements. If there is a specific clause in a copyright agreement
that implies that I cannot archive my paper on the Net, I strike that clause.
If there is no such clause, I archive my articles on the Net just as I
used to distribute reprints of my article.
<p>But this is why I said that the copyright issue is not concerned with
our archiving of our preprints on the Net -- we definitely retain copyright
there -- but with assigning copyright to our publisher! Many people are
now working out limited copyright arrangements with their publishers.
<p>But there is no need for authors to wait for publishers to agree to
more limited copyright arrangements. There is a completely legal way to
self-archive one's refereed research even after having signed the most
restrictive copyright transfer agreement -- as long as one has first self-archived
the unrefereed preprint: <a href="http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/2-Resolving-the-Anomaly/sld007.htm">Just
append the "corrigenda"</a>: "The reader may wish to make the following
changes in order to correct the preprint to make it conform to the refereed
final draft"...
<blockquote><i>Many of the legal issues surrounding the Internet, online
services, service providers, and copyright and privacy in the electronic
world are murky, confused in the courts or soon to be there, and, of course,
rapidly changing.</i></blockquote>
They are certainly murky and confused; and some parties are benefiting
from keeping them that way: The nontrade author, who seeks and gets no
royalties for his articles, has nothing to protect in court! He is not
selling his texts, so he does not worry about, but rather applauds, their
"theft"!
<p>Copyright protection of <u>authorship</u> is, if anything, more enforceable
on the Net than in paper. For although, to be sure, it is easier for me
to pick up your text from the Net and pass it off as my own than it is
to do it in paper, duplication of text is also much easier to <u>detect</u>
in digital texts. So there's a trade-off: If I want to steal your paper
text and publish it as my own, I have to scan it in with OCR, which is
more labour-intensive than stealing bytes that have already been digitized,
but it is probably also safer for me, because then I can publish it as
my own in some other journal, and it is unlikely to be detected. Whereas
on the Net, where gremlins are already scouring the entire world of digital
texts as search engines 24 hours a day, my crime is much more likely to
be found out.
<p>Besides, this is nonsense anyway: Priority can be established much more
rigorously and universally on the Net than in any other medium -- using
encryption and date-coding.
<p>So the legal issues referred to above concern only the <u>trade</u>&nbsp;
(i.e., <u>non</u>-give-away) literature, where it is the <u>text</u> that
one wants to protect from theft; for us, nontrade (give-away) authors (or
at least when we are wearing our refereed-research-reporter hats, for of
course sometimes we do trade publishing
<br>[e.g., textbooks, monographs, trade magazine articles] too!) it is
only the <u>authorship</u> that we wish to protect from theft, and that
is not at issue in any of this.
<blockquote><i>The APA P&amp;C Board has, therefore, adopted an "interim"
policy:</i>
<p><i>Authors are instructed not to put their manuscripts on the</i>
<br><i>Internet at any stage (draft, submitted for publication, in press,</i>
<br><i>or published). Authors should be aware that they run a risk of</i>
<br><i>having (a) their papers stolen, altered, or distributed without</i>
<br><i>their permission and, very importantly, (b) an editor regard such</i>
<br><i>papers as previously "published" and not eligible as a</i>
<br><i>submission a position taken by most APA journal editors.</i></blockquote>
This slightly garbled text is reproduced here verbatim. It calls to mind
the sort of mumbling and stammering and coughing with which this sentence
must have been uttered, because of course the editors, being us, have <u>not</u>
taken this position, and certainly not on their own initiative. They have
been drawn into it by the kinds of self-interested smoke-screen I have
been trying here to dispel.
<p>But I repeat that I prefer subversion to confrontation and conflict.
I am sufficiently adept in this medium to be able to alert the vast preponderance
of research psychologists, including, of course, those that are serving
their terms as editors and associate editors (and referees, and authors
and readers) of the APA journals. I could tell them all exactly what I
have told you, and it would certainly make the scales fall from the eyes
of many of them -- for very few of us have really given all this much thought:
We are so accustomed to seeing the refereed journals as the disinterested
arbiters of the quality of our research (as they certainly are) that we
forget that there is also a trade side to learned journal publishing that
has only an <u>accidental</u> relation to the invaluable service the journals
perform for us -- and, in the on-line era, is actually in conflict with
the best interests of research and research impact.
<p>So if an author who knows that his job, his salary, his tenure, his
likelihood of receiving research funds, prizes etc. all depend on the refereed
journals, he will be easily persuaded that the "journals" are being as
wise and disinterested when they formulate "interim policies" like the
above one for us as they are in weighing the quality of our research.
<p>But the source of this interim policy is not, and could not be, <u>us</u>
(contrary to the case of peer review itself, where it <u>is</u> us). <u>We</u>
are not saying that we regard preprints archived on the Web as publications,
ineligible for refereeing; <u>we</u> are not the ones who say that upon
acceptance for <u>public</u>ation, we must not make our refereed findings
public in the most powerful and ubiquitous medium that our species has
ever created!
<p>So you see that if I chose the polemical path, I would not be at a loss
for words that would gird the research community into action.
<p>But I prefer to take the peaceful path that the sensible physicists
have quietly but firmly taken: to just go ahead and <u>do </u>it, and then
let nature take its course.
<p>Moreover, I hope that although what I've called "the inevitable and
the optimal" solution for the learned research community will necessarily
entail some downsizing by the big learned serials publishers -- especially
the commercial ones -- I am still not among the most radical reformers
in this area, who advocate that the peers should simply bolt from the existing
journals and and re-establish their editorial boards, referees, and authors
with new electronic-only publishers who are not already committed to the
trade model that is at the heart of the profound conflict of interest that
separates us from learned serials publishers at this critical juncture
in the history of learned inquiry.
<blockquote><i>In addition, after acceptance for publication, the publisher
is the copyright holder. APA does not permit authors to post the full text
of their APA-published papers on the Internet at this time, as developments
in the online world cannot be predicted. The APA will, however, closely
follow such Internet developments. The P&amp;C Board will establish a task
force in June 1997 to investigate developments and recommend a longer term
APA policy.</i></blockquote>
No doubt. But while there will no doubt be many developments for the task
force to worry about, there is no reason for us to accept this arbitrary
and unjustifiable stricture while the task force sorts things out! On the
contrary, we should move vigorously toward the optimal and the inevitable,
rather than allowing it to be needlessly delayed by those whose interests
are so clearly in conflict with our own.
<p>I recommend this because I really believe that it is our proceeding
quietly but firmly along the path of subversion that will eventually bring
publishers to their senses, and persuade them to restructure themselves
in such a way as to continue to provide a service that is <u>consonant</u>
with our interests, rather than contrary to them. For if an explicit confrontation
is forced, I am afraid the traditional publishers are bound to be the losers.

<blockquote><i>"Thanks for the lengthy treatise on these matters. However,
I still do</i>
<br><i>not feel that you have addressed the following question: Do you
really</i>
<br><i>think that editors of virtual journals are likely to be able to</i>
<br><i>maintain the high standards of quality and moderate standards of</i>
<br><i>succinctness that characterizes our journals, when there are no</i>
<br><i>cost-enforced controls on the number and length articles in each</i>
<br><i>journal?"</i></blockquote>
Actually, I think it will be the opposite: The very best journals will
accept only the very best of articles, because not only will their page
quota be unlimited in the positive direction (they will be able to accept
as many articles as they like), but they will feel no pressure pushing
them in the negative direction either: Paper journals need to fill their
full annual page quotas or they lose those pages, which are budgeted and
paid for. So on the Net they will be able to afford to accept more or less
on the basis of quality alone, with no consideration of space.
<p>In a nut-shell: Journal quality is determined by their <u>rejection
rate</u>. The higher your cut-off point, the higher your quality, the bell-curve
being what it is. This is medium-independent, and will be as true for on-line
journals without page limits as it was for on-paper journals with page
limits.
<p>Do you really think it is space constraints that decide which articles
go into <i>JEP</i> rather than <i>QJEP</i>? It's <a href="http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/nature2.html">peer
review</a>; the referees do the evaluation and the editors set the threshold.
<p>The reason the quality/prestige hierarchy among journals with different
levels of refereeing rigor exists is not because the best journals have
page quotas: it is because they have higher refereeing thresholds. There
is no reason that <i>Nature</i> or <i>Science</i> (with their impact factors
of 27.1 and 21.9) should lower their standards in the electronic medium;
by the same token, why would we expect <i>BBS</i> (15.7) <i>Psych Review</i>
(5.1) <i>JEP:G</i> (3.5), or <i>QJEP</i> (1.4) to lower theirs? In what
sense is devaluing their quality-currency advantageous for learned journals,
whose gold standard is quality, not quantity? Freed from page constraints
and costs, what incentive is there to accept more than the best? Indeed,
the Net will provide much more sensitive and informative ways of measuring
the impact of authors and journals, which will always be there as feedback
for journals should they inadvertently drop their guard.
<p>In short, I think that, medium-independently, it is the level of rigor
of peer review rather than space pressures that safeguard the quality of
learned journals.
<p>But for CogPrints, these questions are not even at issue, because CogPrints
is not to be a journal but a preprint and reprint archive...
