<h1>Issue/Bug Reporting</h1>

<p>If, as happens inevitably with a project of this size, you come across a problem or bug, please don't just mail us at <strong>eprints.org</strong>. We have a <A HREF="http://bugs.eprints.org/">bug tracking system</A> so that you can see if anyone else has encountered the same problem, and whether there is a fix available. If you have encountered a problem that no one else has reported, please submit a report to the bug tracking system. The system will inform us by email that you've submitted the bug, so it will receive instant attention.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions or items for a wishlist, you should also submit them using the bug tracking system to the <em>wishlist</em> category.</p>

<P>Please note that you should also report errors in documentation (for example, the installation document) and make suggestions for improvement using the bug tracking system.</P>

<p>The bug tracking system is for tracking eprints.org software issues submitted by those running and maintaining an archive. If you are a user who has encountered a problem while using such an archive (such as <a href="http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk">CogPrints</a>), please contact the site administrator of that archive.</P>

<P>The bug tracking system is at the following address:</P>
