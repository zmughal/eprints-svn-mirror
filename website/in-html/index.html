<P><B>(23rd Jan 2001) Version 1.1.1 Released</B> - Includes support for 
<A href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.htm">Open Archives Protocol 1.0</A>, See the <A href="download.html">download</A> page for a list of improvements.</P>

<P>Welcome to <B>eprints.org</B>, dedicated to the freeing of the refereed
research literature online through <A HREF="links.html#discussion">author/institution
self-archiving</A>.
<P>Self-archiving <A HREF="software.html">software</A>,
<B>eprints.org</B>, has been developed at the <A HREF="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk">Electronics
and Computer Science Department</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.soton.ac.uk">University
of Southampton</A>.
<P>The<B> eprints</B> software is already running as the <A HREF="http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/">CogPrints
Cognitive Sciences Eprint Archive</A>, a <A HREF="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</A>-funded
Open Archive for the research literature, both pre- and post-refereeing.
<B>CogPrints </B>is a centralised, discipline-based Open Archive. The <B>eprints
</B>software has now been re-designed to be as flexible and adaptable as
possible so that universities can adopt and configure it with minimal effort
for all disciplines. Hence it complements centralised, discipline-based
archiving with distributed, institution-based archiving.</P>

<P>The generic version of <B>eprints</B> is fully <B>interoperable</B>
with all other OAI-Compliant <A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/">Open
Archives</A>. This means that it no longer matters <I>where</I>
papers are archived; the papers in all OAI-compliant Archives
can be            harvested using the 
<A href="http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.htm">OAI protocol</A>
 into one global "virtual archive"
by <A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_services.htm">Open Archives
Service Providers</A> such as the <A HREF="http://arc.cs.odu.edu/">Cross
Archive Searching Service</A>.</P>

<P>An earlier private beta release of <B>eprints</B> met with unanimous
approval. The first complete operational release 
has been available (for free, of             
course) since December 1 2000. As an example of a site that has adopted         
<B>eprints</B>, see the 
<A href="http://www.escholarship.cdlib.org/eprints.html">California Digital Library</A>.</P>

page</A> (also available <A HREF="fr/software.html">in
French</A>.) If you wish to be e-mailed about the availability of the software,
