<P>Welcome to <B>eprints.org</B>, dedicated to the freeing of the refereed
research literature online through <A HREF="http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/links.html#discussion">author/institution
self-archiving</A>.
<P>Self-archiving <A HREF="http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/software.html">software</A>,
<B>eprints.org</B>, as been developed at the <A HREF="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk">Electronics
and Computer Science Department</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.soton.ac.uk">University
of Southampton</A>.
<P>The<B> eprints</B> software is already running as the <A HREF="http://cogprints.soton.ac.uk/">CogPrints
Cognitive Sciences Eprint Archive</A>, a <A HREF="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</A>-funded
Open Archive for the research literature, both pre- and post-refereeing.
<B>CogPrints </B>is a centralized, discipline-based Open Archive. The <B>eprints
</B>software has now been re-designed to be as flexible and adaptable as
possible so that universities can adopt and configure it with minimal effort
for all disciplines. Hence it complements centralized, discipline-based
archiving with distributed, institution-based archiving.
<P>The generic version of <B>eprints</B> is fully <B>interoperable</B>
with all other Open Archives participating in the <A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/">Open
Archives Initiative</A>. This means that it no longer matters <I>where</I>
papers are archived; the papers in all Open Archives registered as <A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_archives.htm">Open
Archives Data Providers</A> can be harvested into one global "virtual archive"
by <A HREF="http://www.openarchives.org/sfc/sfc_services.htm">Open Archives
Service Providers</A> such as the <A HREF="http://arc.cs.odu.edu/">Cross
Archive Searching Service</A>.
<P>An earlier private beta release of <B>eprints</B> met with unanimous
approval. A public beta release is now available from <A HREF="http://www.eprints.org/">eprints.org</A>.
The first complete release (for free, of course) will be in November 2000.
<P>Technical information about the software is available on the <A HREF="http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/software.html">software
page</A> (also available <A HREF="http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/fr/software.html">in
French</A>.) If you wish to be e-mailed about the availability of the software,
you can join a <A HREF="http://www.cogsci.soton.ac.uk/~harnad/Tp/list.html">mailing
list</A>.
