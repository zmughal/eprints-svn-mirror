eprints.org software history

2000-07-04 - Beta-1 Released


2000-09-29 - Beta-2 Released.

Changes in core code:

- Slight directory restructure. No longer need symlink into
/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl (or equivalent), use "PERL5LIB" environment variable
instead. This is cleaner, and allows >1 eprints service to run on a single
machine more easily.
- Now refers to "deposits" rather than "submissions", to avoid journal
connotations.
- Minor fix to e-mail parsing code in bin/process_mail.
- Staff couldn't edit eprints in submission buffer, this resulted in an error.
Fixed.
- Flawed disk space calculation fixed.
- Now uses URI::Heuristic to improve Web grabbing flexibility
- Better guessing of "show first" file during Web grabbing
- No longer prepends "Clone of" to titles of cloned eprints - this caused
confusion and people tended to leave it in
- Can now add elements to the <HEAD> segment of Web pages
- Search script now easier to call externally. Now assumes that if any
parameters are passed in, a search should be attempted. This makes it easy to
add "quick search" forms or standard searches to other (possibly external) Web
pages.
- In the "threads" of eprint versions and commentaries/responses, the date at
which each was deposited is now displayed.
- Slight rewording around these "threads" to make them easier to understand.
- Cleaned up Open Archives interface in anticipation of new protocol. Current
version still only exports OAMS, however.
- Changed "spec" field subscription table to be "multitext" rather than "text"
(in MySQL, TEXT instead of VARCHAR(255)). Some specs turned out to be longer
than 255 characters long and so weren't stored correctly.
- Various updates to on-line help.
- Open Archives exported metadata now properly encoded in UTF-8, using
Unicode-String module.

Site default configuration changes:

- Added references metadata field to eprints. This can be used by automatic
citation linkers in the future.
- Added "expertise" metadata field to user records.
- Fixed errors in automatic reply to unrecognised autoadmin message.
- Fixed error in user introduction message.
- Made it clearer how to set up with a non-standard port.
- Can specify multiple metadata formats for export via open archives protocols;
however, N.B. current (Santa Fe) core code will only at present handle "OAMS".
- Minor fixes to reference renderings.
- Now ensures authors enter scheme (e.g. "http:" when they enter their "home
page URL". Too many authors were entering just e.g. "www.foo.bar", meaning the
link didn't work.
- No longer insists for page and volume numbers for "unpublished" or "in press"
journal papers.
- Changes to wording in default Web pages, including a couple of HTML syntax
fixes.
